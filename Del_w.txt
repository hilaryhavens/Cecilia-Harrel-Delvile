To MISS BEVERLEY
	September 20 1779
What could be the apprehensions the suspicions of Miss Beverley when so earnestly she prohibited my writing From a temper so unguarded as mine could she fear any subtlety of doctrine Is my character so little known to her that she can think me capable of craft or duplicity Had I even the desire I have neither the address nor the patience to practise them no loveliest Miss Beverley though sometimes by vehemence I may incautiously offend by sophistry believe me I never shall injure my ambition as I have told you is to convince not beguile and my arguments shall be simple as my professions shall be sincere
Yet how again may I venture to mention a proposal which so lately almost before you had heard you rejected Suffer me however to assure you it resulted neither from insensibility to your delicacy nor to my own duty I made it on the contrary with that reluctance and timidity which were given me by an apprehension that both seemed to be offended by it but alas already I have said what with grief I must repeat I have no resource no alternative between receiving the honour of your hand in secret or foregoing you for-ever
You will wonder you may well wonder at such a declaration and again that severe renunciation with which you wounded me will tremble on your lips Oh there let it stop nor let the air again be agitated with sounds so discordant
In that cruel and heart-breaking moment when I tore myself from you at Delvile-Castle I confessed to you the reason of my flight and I determined to see you no more I named not to you then my family the potency of my own objections against daring to solicit your favour rendering their’s immaterial my own are now wholly removed  but their’s remain in full force
My father descended of a race which though decaying in wealth is unsubdued in pride considers himself as the guardian of the honour of his house to which he holds the name of his ancestors inseparably annexed my mother born of the same family and bred to the same ideas has strengthened this opinion by giving it the sanction of her own
Such being their sentiments you will not madam be surprised that their only son the sole inheritor of their fortune and sole object of their expectations should early have admitted the same Indeed almost the first lesson I was taught was that of reverencing the family from which I am descended and the name to which I am born I was bid consider myself as its only remaining support and sedulously instructed neither to act nor think but with a view to its aggrandizement and dignity
Thus unchecked by ourselves and uncontrouled by the world this haughty self-importance acquired by time a strength and by mutual encouragement a firmness which Miss Beverley alone could possibly I believe have shaken What therefore was my secret alarm when first I was conscious of the force of her attractions and found my mind wholly occupied with admiration of her excellencies All that pride could demand and all to which ambition could aspire all that happiness could covet or the most scrupulous delicacy exact in her I found united and while my heart was enslaved by her charms my understanding exulted in its fetters   Yet to forfeit my name to give up for-ever a family which upon me rested its latest expectations  Honour I thought forbad it propriety and manly spirit revolted at the sacrifice The renunciation of my birth-right seemed a desertion of the post in which I was stationed I forebore therefore even in my wishes to solicit your favour and vigorously determined to fly you as dangerous to my peace because unattainable without dishonour
Such was the intended regulation of my conduct at the time I received Biddulph’s letter in three days I was to leave England my father with much persuasion had consented to my departure my mother who penetrated into my motives had never opposed it but how great was the change wrought upon my mind by reading that letter my steadiness forsook me my resolution wavered yet I thought him deceived and attributed his suspicions to jealousy but still Fidel I knew was missing and to hear he was your darling companion  was it possible to quit England in a state of such uncertainty to be harrassed in distant climates with conjectures I might then never satisfy No I told my friends I must visit Biddulph before I left the kingdom and promising to return to them in three or four days I hastily set out for Suffolk and rested not till I arrived at Mrs Charlton’s
What a scene there awaited me to behold the loved mistress of my heart the opposed yet resistless object of my fondest admiration caressing an animal she knew to be mine mourning over him his master’s ill health and sweetly recommending to him fidelity  Ah forgive the retrospection I will dwell on it no longer Little indeed had I imagined with what softness the dignity of Miss Beverley was blended though always conscious that her virtues her attractions and her excellencies would reflect lustre upon the highest station to which human grandeur could raise her and would still be more exalted than her rank though that were the most eminent upon earth And had there been a thousand and ten thousand obstacles to oppose my addressing her vigourously and undauntedly would I have combated with them all in preference to yielding to this single objection
Let not the frankness of this declaration irritate you but rather let it serve to convince you of the sincerity of what follows various as are the calamities of life which may render me miserable YOU only among even its chosen felicities have power to make me happy Fame honours wealth ambition were insufficient without you all chance of internal peace and every softer hope is now centered in your favour and to lose you from whatever cause ensures me wretchedness unmitigated
With respect therefore to myself the die is finally cast and the conflict between bosom felicity and family pride is deliberately over This name which so vainly I have cherished and so painfully supported I now find inadequate to recompense me for the sacrifice which its preservation requires I part with it I own with regret that the surrender is necessary yet is it rather an imaginary than an actual evil and though a deep wound to pride no offence to morality
Thus have I laid open to you my whole heart confessed my perplexities acknowledged my vain-glory and exposed with equal sincerity the sources of my doubts and the motives of my decision but now indeed how to proceed I know not the difficulties which are yet to encounter I fear to enumerate and the petition I have to urge I have scarce courage to mention
My family mistaking ambition for honour and rank for dignity have long planned a splendid connection for me to which though my invariable repugnance has stopt any advances their wishes and their views immovably adhere I am but too certain they will now listen to no other I dread therefore to make a trial where I despair of success I know not how to risk a prayer with those who may silence me by a command
In a situation so desperate what then remains Must I make an application with a certainty of rejection and then mock all authority by acting in defiance of it Or harder task yet relinquish my dearest hopes when no longer persuaded of their impropriety Ah sweetest Miss Beverley end the struggle at once My happiness my peace are wholly in your power for the moment of our union secures them for life
It may seem to you strange that I should thus purpose to brave the friends whom I venture not to entreat but from my knowledge of their characters and sentiments I am certain I have no other resource Their favourite principles were too early imbibed to be now at this late season eradicated Slaves that we all are to habits and dupes to appearances jealous guardians of our pride to which our comfort is sacrificed and even our virtue made subservient what conviction can be offered by reason to notions that exist but by prejudice They have been cherished too long for rhetorick to remove them they can only be expelled by all-powerful Necessity Life is indeed too brief and success too precarious to trust in any case where happiness is concerned the extirpation of deep-rooted and darling opinions to the slow-working influence of argument and disquisition
Yet bigotted as they are to rank and family they adore Miss Beverley and though their consent to the forfeiture of their name might for-ever be denied when once they beheld her the head and ornament of their house her elegance and accomplishments joined to the splendour of her fortune would speedily make them forget the plans which now wholly absorb them Their sense of honour is in nothing inferior to their sense of high birth your condescension therefore would be felt by them in its fullest force and though during their first surprize they might be irritated against their son they would make it the study of their lives that the lady who for him had done so much should never through their means repine for herself
With regard to settlements the privacy of our union would not affect them one Confident we must unavoidably trust and I would deposit in the hands of whatever person you would name a bond by which I would engage myself to settle both your fortune and my own according to the arbitration of our mutual friends
The time for secrecy though painful would be short and even from the altar if you desired it I would hasten to Delvile-Castle Not one of my friends should you see till they waited upon you themselves to solicit your presence at their house till our residence elsewhere was fixed
Oh loveliest Cecilia from a dream of a happiness so sweet awaken me not from a plan of felicity so attractive turn not away If one part of it is unpleasant reject not therefore all and since without some drawback no earthly bliss is attainable do not by a refinement too scrupulous for the short period of our existence deny yourself that delight which your benevolence will afford you in snatching from the pangs of unavailing regret and misery the gratefullest of men in the
humblest and most devoted
of your servants

TO MISS BEVERLEY

May this letter with one only from Delvile-Castle be the last that Miss Beverley may ever receive
Yet sweet to me as is that hope I write in the utmost uneasiness I have just heard that a gentleman whom by the description that is given of him I imagine is Mr Monckton has been in search of me with a letter which he was anxious to deliver immediately
Perhaps this letter is from Miss Beverley perhaps it contains directions which ought instantly to be followed could I divine what they are with what eagerness would I study to anticipate their execution It will not I hope be too late to receive them on Saturday when her power over my actions will be confirmed and when every wish she will communicate shall be gratefully joyfully and with delight fulfilled
I have sought Belfield in vain he has left Lord Vannelt and no one knows whither he is gone I have been obliged therefore to trust a stranger to draw up the bond but he is a man of good character and the time of secresy will be too short to put his discretion in much danger To-morrow Friday I shall spend solely in endeavouring to discover Mr Monckton I have leisure sufficient for the search since so prosperous has been my diligence that every thing is prepared
I have seen some lodgings in Pall-Mall which I think are commodious and will suit you send a servant therefore before you to secure them If upon your arrival I should venture to meet you there be not I beseech you offended or alarmed I shall take every possible precaution neither to be known nor seen and I will stay with you only three minutes The messenger who carries this is ignorant from whom it comes for I fear his repeating my name among your servants and he could scarce return to me with an answer before you will yourself be in town Yes loveliest Cecilia at the very moment you receive this letter the chaise will I flatter myself be at the door which is to bring to me a treasure that will enrich every future hour of my life And oh as to me it will be exhaustless may but its sweet dispenser experience some share of the happiness she bestows and then what save her own purity will be so perfect so unsullied as the felicity of her

TO MISS BEVERLEY

YOU drive me from you Cecilia tortured with suspense and distracted with apprehension you drive me from you certain of my misery yet leaving me to bear it as I may I would call you unfeeling but that I saw you were unhappy I would reproach you with tyranny but that your eyes when you quitted me were swolen with weeping I go therefore I obey the harsh mandate since my absence is your desire and I will shut myself up at Biddulph’s till I receive your commands Yet disdain not to reflect that every instant will seem endless while Cecilia must appear to me unjust or wound my very soul by the recollection of her in sorrow
	MORTIMER DELVILE

TO Miss BEVERLEY

I entreat you to see me if only for an instant I entreat I implore you to see me Mrs Charlton may be present  all the world if you wish it may be present but deny me not admission I supplicate I conjure you
I will call in an hour in that time you may have finished your present engagement I will otherwise wait longer and call again You will not I think turn me from your door and till I have seen you I can only live in its vicinity

To Dr Lyster

TELL me my dear Sir how you have found my mother I am uneasy at your long stay and engaged with my friend Biddulph or I should have followed you in person

To Miss Belfield	

Mr Delvile presents his compliments to Miss Belfield and begs to be permitted to wait upon her for a few minutes at any time in the afternoon she will be so good as to appoint
To Miss Beverley

April 2d 1780
I must write without comments for I dare not trust myself with making any I must write without any beginning address for I know not how you will permit me to address you
I have lived a life of tumult since last compelled to leave you and when it may subside I am still in utter ignorance
The affecting account of the losses you have suffered thro' your beneficence to the Harrels and the explanatory one of the calumnies you have sustained from your kindness to the Belfields I related with the plainness which alone I thought necessary to make them felt I then told the high honour I had received in meeting with no other repulse to my proposal than was owing to an inability to accede to it and informed my mother of the condescending powers with which you had invested her In conclusion I mentioned my new scheme and firmly before I would listen to any opposition I declared that though wholly to their decision I left the relinquishing my own name or your fortune I was not only by your generosity more internally yours than ever but that since again I had ventured and with permission to apply to you I should hold myself hence forward unalterably engaged to you
And so I do and so I shall nor after a renewal so public will any prohibition but yours have force to keep me from throwing myself at your feet
My father's answer I will not mention I would I could forget it his prejudices are irremediable his resolutions are inflexible Who or what has worked him into an animosity so irreclaimable I cannot conjecture 
nor will he tell but something darkly mysterious has part in his wrath and his injustice
My mother was much affected by your reference to herself Words of the sweetest praise broke repeatedly from her no other such woman she said existed no other such instance could be found of sidelity so exalted her son must have no heart but for low and mercenary selfishness if after a proof of regard so unexampled he could bear to live without her Oh how did such a sentence from lips so highly reverenced animate delight confirm and oblige me at once
The displeasure of my father at this declaration was dreadful his charges always as improbable as injurious now became too horrible for my ears he disbelieved you had taken up the money for Harrel he discredited that you visited the Belfields for Henrietta passion not merely banished his justice but clouded his reason and I soon left the room that at least I might not hear the aspersions he forbid me to answer
I left not however your same to a weak champion my mother defended it with all the spirit of truth and all the confidence of similar virtue yet they parted without conviction and so mutually irritated with each other that they agreed to meet no more
This was too terrible and I insantly consolidated my resentment to my father and my gratitude to my mother into concessions and supplications to both I could not however succeed my mother was deeply offended my father was sternly inexorable nor here rests the evil of their dissention for the violence of the conflict has occasioned a return more alarming than ever of the illness of my mother
All her faith in her recovery is now built upon going abroad she is earnest to set off immediately but Dr Lyster has advised her to make London in her way and have a consultation of physicians before she departs
To this she has agreed and we are now upon the road thither
Such is at present the melancholy slate of my affairs My mother advised me to write forgive me therefore that I waited not something more decisive to say I could prevail upon neither party to meet before the journey nor could I draw from my father the base fabricator of the calumnies by which he has been thus abused
Unhappily I have nothing more to add and whether intelligence such as this or total suspense would be least irksome I know not If my mother bears her journey tolerably well I have yet one more effort 
to make and of that the success or the failure will be instantly communicated to Miss Beverley by her eternally devoted but half distracted
Mortimer Delvile
To Miss Beverley

My Cecilia

Be alone I conjure you dismiss every body and admit me this moment
I fear to alarm you by rash precipitation I fear to alarm you by lingering suspense but all is not well
