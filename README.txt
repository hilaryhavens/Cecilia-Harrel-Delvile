The six txt files represent all spoken (s) and written (w) language by Mortimer Delvile (Del) and Mr. Harrel (Har) in Frances Burney's _Cecilia_ (1782).  The combinations should be apparent in the labeling, and the spoken and written files for both characters were used in the text analysis.  Using text search for Delvile and Harrel, I identified every conversation in which those two characters took place, and after reading those conversations carefully, extracted only their spoken (and written) text.  I removed punctuation marks and narration, though there are still some special characters that need to be removed.

The textual transformations I performed using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) platform can be found in the Jupyter notebook file "Cecilia_Harrel_and_Delvile_Language.ipynb".  The data presented in my paper for the 2023 Burney Society Conference, "Strange Shackles in Frances Burney's _Cecilia_," has been taken from this file.
