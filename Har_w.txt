To be all paid to-night with a BULLET

For Mrs HARREL Miss BEVERLEY and Mr ARNOTT

I can struggle no longer the last blow must now be struck another day robs me of my house and my liberty and blasts me by the fatal discovery of my double attempts
This is what I have wished wholly to be freed or ruined past all resource and driven to the long-projected remedy
A burthen has my existence been these two years gay as I have appeared not a night have I gone to bed but heated and inflamed from a gaming table not a morning have I awaked but to be soured with a dun
I would not lead such a life again if the slave who works hardest at the oar would change with me
Had I a son I would bequeath him a plough I should then leave him happier than my parents left me
Idleness has been my destruction the want of something to do led me into all evil
A good wife perhaps might have saved me mine I thank her tried not Disengaged from me and my affairs her own pleasures and amusements have occupied her solely Dreadful will be the catastrophe she will see to-night let her bring it home and live better
It any pity is felt for me it will be where I have least deserved it Mr Arnott Miss Beverley it will come from you
To bring myself to this final resolution hard I confess have been my conflicts it is not that I have feared death no I have long wished it for shame and dread have embittered my days but something there is within me that causes a deeper horror that asks my preparation for another world that demands my authority for quitting this what may hereafter O terrible Pray for me generous Miss Beverley  kind gentle Mr Arnott pray for me
