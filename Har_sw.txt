Come come it is time I should hasten my fair ward away if this is your method of describing the place she is going to live in
Well Miss Beverley will you now venture to accompany me to town Or has Mr Monckton frightened you from proceeding any farther
What don’t you chuse to play Miss Beverley
O you must take a few lessons Sir Robert Floyer I am sure will be proud to instruct you
O you will learn better things we have had you yet but three days amongst us in three months we shall see the difference
I wish he was hanged for he has kept me waiting this hour He made me promise not to ride out till he called and now he’ll stay till the morning is over
In Cavendish-square Sir 
Pray who is this Genius and what has he run away for
I hope Sir you have not given yourself the trouble of going to him
Sir you are extremely good but I had not the least intention of your taking such a walk upon my account
But Miss Beverley you don’t tell me what you think of my friend
Why Sir Robert Floyer I observed he never quitted you a moment while he stayed at Mrs Mears
Surely you can find no fault with him he is one of the most fashionable men I know
You are a pretty fellow a’n’t you to keep me waiting so long
Not very early but you were too much engaged to miss me By the way what do you think I lost
No I have not one that will do for you You must send to Astley
Why Miss Beverley this friend of yours is the most obliging gentleman I ever met with there was no avoiding asking him to dinner
Miss Beverley I am glad you are not gone for we want much to consult with you Will you come up stairs
A debt to whom
O what what that woman Well well I’ll see she shall be paid Come let us go to the library
Pho pho there's no such hurry I don’t know what I have done with her bill
O upon no account She may send another in two or three days She deserves to wait a twelvemonth for her impertinence in troubling you at all about it
O what a dismal tale has she been telling you no doubt she saw you were fresh from the country But if you give credit to all the farragos of these trumpery impostors you will never have a moment to yourself nor a guinea in your purse
O when you know the town better you will soon see through tricks of this sort a sick husband and five small children are complaints so stale now that they serve no other purpose in the world but to make a joke
All imposition depend upon it The moment she is out of your sight her complaints will vanish
Pray how did she get at you
I cannot say I have never had time to look at it
Yes yes I know who the woman is well enough she has taken care of that for she has pestered me every day these nine months
Pray why does not the man come himself
Well when he is better he may call and I will talk to him
 Well won’t you come
You are very good for coming we can settle nothing without your advice pray look at these different plans for our theatre and tell us which is the best
Miss Beverley will to-morrow be soon enough for your Protegeé
Well then will you take the trouble to bid her come to me in the morning
I wonder when she intends to die
Done ’tis an excellent motion
Well Miss Beverley how fares it with your protegée I hope at length she is contented But I must beg you would charge her to keep her own counsel as otherwise she will draw me into a scrape I shall not thank her for
Yes I promised you I would you know
I have some thoughts of running up a flight of steps and a little light gallery here and so making a little Orchestra What would such a thing come to Mr Tomkins
Well then give orders for it and let it be done directly I don't care how slight it is but pray let it be very elegant Won’t it be a great addition Miss Beverley
He’s an insolent scoundrel however if I must speak to him I must and went out of the room
Good Mr Rawlins have a little patience I shall receive a large sum of money to-morrow or next day and you may then depend upon being paid
Certainly Mr Rawlins and certainly you shall have it nobody means to dispute your right I only beg you to wait a day or two days at furthest and you may then depend upon being paid And you shall not be the worse for obliging me I will never employ any body else and I shall have occasion for you very soon as I intend to make some alterations at Violet-Bank that will be very considerable
Here’s the most insolent rascal of a mason below stairs I ever met with in my life he has come upon me quite unexpectedly with a bill of 400 l and won’t leave the house without the money Brother Arnott I wish you would do me the favour to speak to the fellow for I could not bear to stay with him any longer
That would be vastly obliging and I will give you my note for it directly And so we shall get rid of this fellow at once and he shall do nothing more for me as long as he lives I will run up a new building at Violet-Bank next summer if only to shew him what a job he has lost
Scandalous why this is no better than being a house-breaker Pray give orders never to admit him again Three Guineas I never heard so impudent a thing in my life Indeed Miss Beverley you must be more discreet in future you will else be ruined before you know where you are
Nay that was quite another matter expence incurred in the common way of a man’s living is quite another thing to an extortion of this sort
 Miss Beverley I bring you news that will repay all your fright Sir Robert is not only safe but is come off conqueror
Ah Miss Beverley this won’t do now it might have passed a little while ago but it won’t do now I promise you
What then could make you so frightened for him at the Opera-house There has been but one opinion about town ever since of your prepossession in his favour
Is it Mr Arnott
Expect him Yes I have expected him the whole evening and cannot conceive what he has done with himself
I don’t know that Reeves is such a wretch that I am sure he will give me all the trouble in his power
O only a fellow from that rascally taylor who has been so troublesome to me lately He has had the impudence because I did not pay him the moment he was pleased to want his money to put the bill into the hands of one Reeves a griping attorney who has been here this evening and thought proper to talk to me pretty freely I can tell the gentleman I shall not easily forget his impertinence however I really wish mean time I could get rid of him
Why its rather a round sum but I don’t know how it is one’s bills mount up before one is aware those fellows charge such confounded sums for tape and buckram I hardly know what I have had of him and yet he has run me up a bill of between three and four hundred pound
O yes very soon for I shall receive a great deal of money in a little time I only want to stop this fellow’s mouth for the present
O he’s a brute a stock nothing but the money will satisfy him he will hear no reason one might as well talk to a stone
Appeased you might as well appease the sea in a storm he is hard as iron
No no the old curmudgeon would but the rather refuse I know his reason and therefore am sure all pleas will be vain He has dealings in the alley and I dare say games with your money as if it were his own There is indeed one way  but I do not think you would like it  though I protest I hardly know why not  however ’tis as well let alone
Well my good brother I hardly know how to suffer you to sell out at such a loss but yet my present necessity is so urgent  
O pray come in I am only telling Priscilla a piece of my usual ill luck You must know I happen to be in immediate want of 200l though only for three or four days and I sent to order honest old Aaron to come hither directly with the money but it so happens that he went out of town the moment he had done with us yesterday and will not be back again this week Now I don’t believe there is another Jew in the kingdom who will let me have money upon the same terms they are such notorious rascals that I hate the very thought of employing them
O it is provoking indeed for the extra-interest I must pay one of those extortioners is absolutely so much money thrown away
O Lord now I think of it I believe Miss Beverley you can lend me this money yourself for a day or two The moment old Aaron comes to town I will pay you
And now the thing is done I don't like indeed to get into such hands for ’tis hard ever to get out of them when once one begins and hitherto I have kept pretty clear But there’s no help for it Mr Arnott cannot just now assist me and so the thing must take its course Priscilla why do you look so grave
Never in my life never any but old Aaron I dread the whole race I have a sort of superstitious notion that if once I get into their clutches I shall never be my own man again and that induced me to beg your assistance However ’tis no great matter
The 200l O ay true I protest it had escaped me Well but you don’t want it immediately
O yes certainly without the least doubt Though now I think of it its extremely unlucky but really just at this time why did not you put me in mind of it before
I could have paid you two days ago extremely well however you shall certainly have it very soon that you may depend upon and a day or two can make no great difference to you
I am vastly sorry but I am so late now I cannot stop an instant however as soon as I come back I shall be wholly at your command
When we get her to Violet Bank we shall be able to keep a better watch over her
My dear Miss Beverley when young ladies will not know their own minds it is necessary some friend should tell it them you were certainly very favourable to Sir Robert but a short time ago and so I dare say you will be again when you have seen more of him
I fancy you will not easily persuade him to think so your behaviour at the Opera-house was ill calculated to give him that notion
O fie fie Miss Beverley after all that has passed after his long expectations and his constant attendance you cannot for a moment think seriously of discarding him
Come I am sure you have too much honour to make a fool of such a man as Sir Robert Floyer There is not a woman in town who will not envy your choice and I assure you there is not a man in England I would so soon recommend to you 
Young ladies who have been brought up in the country are always so high flown in their notions it is difficult to deal with them but as I am much better acquainted with the world than you can be you must give me leave to tell you that if after all you refuse Sir Robert it will be using him very ill
No no you shall manage it all your own way I will have nothing to do with the quarrels of lovers
Why you do not really mean to remain in town by yourself you cannot suppose that will be an eligible plan for a young lady On the contrary it will be so very improper that I think myself as your Guardian obliged to oppose it
Besides I have a plan for some alterations in the house during my absence and I think your room in particular will be much improved by them but it will be impossible to employ any workmen if we do not all quit the premises
Miss Beverley I am ruined I am undone I am blasted for ever
O I know not I know not but I have not seen her I cannot see her I hope I shall never see her more 
From her affection from her hatred you mean do you not know that she too is ruined Oh past redemption ruined and yet that I should hesitate that I should a moment hesitate to conclude the whole business at once
I have undone Priscilla I have blasted my credit I have destroyed no not yet quite destroyed myself
My debts my creditors one way only is left for me
What will you undertake I know you are an angel tell me what will you undertake
You may as well consult with every cursed creditor in the house but do so if you please my disgrace must perforce reach him soon and a short anticipation is not worth begging off
O yes yes and therefore it is high time I should be out of it Did you not see them Do they not line the hall They threaten me with three executions before night three executions unless I satisfy their immediate demands 
I know not I dare not ask to some thousand pounds perhaps and I have not at this minute forty guineas in the house
Stay and hear me seek out your unfortunate friend go to the poor ruined Priscilla prepare her for tidings of horror and do not though you renounce Me do not abandon Her
To hell
You have stopt me at the very moment I had gathered courage for the blow but if indeed you will assist me I will shut this up if not I will steep it in my blood
And quickly
Before my disgrace is known and while all may yet be hushed up
Swear then
Hear me swear then which at this moment I do by every thing eternal and by every thing infernal that I will not outlive the seizure of my property and that the moment I am informed there is an execution in my house shall be the last of my existence
I believe you are too late the ruffians have already seized my house 
Go to my wife I want to be alone
No no go leave me  I must not now be trifled with
Swear solemnly swear to empty my house of these creditors this moment
I see I see you are an angel and as such I worship and adore you O you have restored me to life and rescued me from perdition
That instrument is nothing since so many others are in my power but you have now taken from me all desire of using them Go then and stop those wretches from coming to me send immediately for the Jew he will advance what money you please my man knows where to find him consult with Mr Arnott speak a word of comfort to Priscilla but do nothing nothing at all till you have cleared my house of those cursed scoundrels
Miss Beverley there is not a moment to be lost this good man will bring you any sum of money upon a proper consideration that you will command but if he is not immediately commissioned and these cursed fellows are not got out of my house the affair will be blown  and what will follow I will not again frighten you by repeating though I shall never recant
My dear Miss Beverley after the extraordinary kindness you have shewn me this morning you will not I am sure deny me one trifling favour which I mean to ask this evening
It is nothing in the world but to go with us to-night to the Pantheon
I see you do not understand the motives of our request The unfortunate affair of this morning is very likely to spread presently all over the town the only refutation that can be given to it is by our all appearing in public before any body knows whether to believe it or not
But if we do not all go we do almost nothing you are known to live with us and your appearance at this critical time is important to our credit If this misfortune gets wind the consequence is that every dirty tradesman in town to whom I owe a shilling will be forming the same cursed combination those scoundrels formed this morning of coming in a body and waiting for their money or else bringing an execution into my house The only way to silence report is by putting a good face upon the matter at once and shewing ourselves to the world as if nothing had happened Favour us therefore tonight with your company which is really important to us or ten to one but in another fortnight I shall be just in the same scrape
Have you any thing to pack up
I am going abroad I shall set off to-morrow
Hope nothing 
Miss Beverley it is high time now to give up this reserve and trifle no longer with a gentleman so unexceptionable as Sir Robert Floyer The whole town has long acknowledged him as your husband and you are every where regarded as his bride a little frankness therefore in accepting him will not only bind him to you for ever but do credit to the generosity of your character
Is this lady-like tyranny then never to end
Pho pho what signifies calling upon me I never saw in Miss Beverley any disapprobation beyond what it is customary for young ladies of a sentimental turn to shew and every body knows that where a gentleman is allowed to pay his devoirs for any length of time no lady intends to use him very severely
If this fails 
You have not I hope Miss Beverley quite determined upon this strange scheme
Well madam at least may I request you will stay here till the evening
And will you not amuse yourself first with seeing bailiffs take possession of my house and your friend Priscilla follow me to Jail
O no should I once think that way  
No no she deserves no such indulgence she has not any reason to complain she has been as negligent as profuse as expensive as myself she has practised neither œconomy nor self-denial she has neither thought of me nor my affairs nor is she now afflicted at any thing but the loss of that affluence she has done her best towards diminishing
Consolation and kindness are out of the question I have ordered a post chaise to be here at night and if till then you will stay I will promise to release you without further petition if not eternal destruction be my portion if I live to see the scene which your removal will occasion
Ask me not questions or reasons how the crisis is at hand and you will soon happen what may know all mean time what I have said is a fact and immutable and you must hasten my end or give me a chance for avoiding it as you think fit I scarce care at this instant which way you decide remember however all I ask of you is to defer your departure what else I have to hope is from Mr Arnott
You should be absolved from all the mischief you may do for a twelvemonth to come in reward for the preservation from mischief which you have this day effected
Perhaps by eight o’clock perhaps by nine you will not mind half an hour
Well ladies who is for Vauxhall
Come come we have no time to lose A hackney coach will serve us we won’t wait for our own
No no where can we go from half so well let us live while we live I have ordered a chaise to be in waiting there Come let’s be gone
She shall return with you if you desire it you shall return together
Yes if you will make a better friend than you have made a wife and if Miss Beverley is content to take charge of you
I am and I will
come what do we wait for if we go not immediately we may be prevented
Come I wait not another minute
No no I must take care of her myself I shall not carry her abroad with me but the only legacy I can leave her is a warning which I hope she will remember for ever You however need not go
What of that do you not desire to be left have you any regard for me or for any thing upon earth but yourself cease these vain clamours and come I insist upon it this moment
And why why should you go you want no warning you need no terror better far had you fly us and my wife when I am set out may find you
this is not to be borne
my chaise will soon be ready and I shall take of you a long farewell all my affairs are unpropitious to my speedy return the wine is now mounting into my head and perhaps I may not be able to say much by and by I fear I have been cruel to you Priscilla and I begin to wish I had spared you this parting scene yet let it not be banished your remembrance but think of it when you are tempted to such mad folly as has ruined us
Oh Madam to you indeed I dare not speak I have used you most unworthily but I pay for it all I I ask you not to pity or forgive me I know it is impossible you should do either
Do not hope be not so angelic for I cannot bear it benevolence like yours should have fallen into worthier hands But come let us return to the company My head grows giddy but my heart is still heavy I must make them more fit companions for each other
Why not what shall we not be merry before we part Yes we will all be merry for if we are not how shall we part at all  Oh not without a struggle   
I commit this packet to you had I written it later its contents had been kinder to my wife for now the hour of separation approaches ill will and resentment subside Poor Priscilla I am sorry but you will succour her I am sure you will Oh had I known you myself before this infatuation bright pattern of all goodness but I was devoted a ruined wretch before ever you entered my house unworthy to be saved unworthy that virtues such as yours should dwell under the same roof with me But come come now or my resolution will waver and I shall not go at last
No matter no matter you will know by and by the chaise waits and I must gather courage to be gone
No Sir but I shall answer it to-morrow and to-night I hope you will do me the honour of supping with me
Think not of that these two hours come let us look for a box
Sir yours
Ay Sir come to me to-morrow and you shall exchange as many as you please
And if you were all for broken bones I would oblige you with them without delay
Do why give them all a supper to be sure Come gentlemen will you favour me with your company to supper
Mad no not mad but merry O ho Mr Morrice why have you been so long what have you done for us
Won’t he have at him then
Bottle a most excellent hint Mr Hobson come let us all make free with the bottle
Ay say to me and so have I to say to you Come amongst us and be merry Here make room make way Sit close my friends

To be all paid to-night with a BULLET

For Mrs HARREL Miss BEVERLEY and Mr ARNOTT

I can struggle no longer the last blow must now be struck another day robs me of my house and my liberty and blasts me by the fatal discovery of my double attempts
This is what I have wished wholly to be freed or ruined past all resource and driven to the long-projected remedy
A burthen has my existence been these two years gay as I have appeared not a night have I gone to bed but heated and inflamed from a gaming table not a morning have I awaked but to be soured with a dun
I would not lead such a life again if the slave who works hardest at the oar would change with me
Had I a son I would bequeath him a plough I should then leave him happier than my parents left me
Idleness has been my destruction the want of something to do led me into all evil
A good wife perhaps might have saved me mine I thank her tried not Disengaged from me and my affairs her own pleasures and amusements have occupied her solely Dreadful will be the catastrophe she will see to-night let her bring it home and live better
It any pity is felt for me it will be where I have least deserved it Mr Arnott Miss Beverley it will come from you
To bring myself to this final resolution hard I confess have been my conflicts it is not that I have feared death no I have long wished it for shame and dread have embittered my days but something there is within me that causes a deeper horror that asks my preparation for another world that demands my authority for quitting this what may hereafter O terrible Pray for me generous Miss Beverley  kind gentle Mr Arnott pray for me
