I’ll cross him though he blast me
Harlequin do you fear to fight the devil
Your persecutor I presume is known to you
O depend upon it there are many who would be happy to confine you in the same manner neither have you much cause for complaint you have doubtless been the aggressor and played this game yourself without mercy for I read in your face the captivity of thousands have you then any right to be offended at the spirit of retaliation which one out of such numbers has courage to exert in return
From seeing the danger to which my incautious knight errantry has exposed me I begin indeed to take you for a very mischievous sort of person and I fear the poor devil from whom I rescued you will be amply revenged for his disgrace by finding that the first use you make of your freedom is to doom your deliverer to bondage
Can you conjecture who was making those soft speeches a Shylock his knife all the time in his hand and his design doubtless to cut as near the heart as possible while the loud cackling from the other side is owing to the riotous merriment of a noisy Mentor when next I hear a disturbance I shall expect to see some simpering Pythagoras stunned by his talkative disciples
You cannot then have wanted amusement for among all the persons assembled in these apartments I have seen only three who have seemed conscious that any change but that of dress was necessary to disguise them
A Don Quixote a school-master and your friend the devil
My friend then I will call him for so were he ten devils I must think him since I owe to him the honour of conversing with you And after all to give him his due to which you know he is even proverbially entitled he has shewn such abilities in the performance of his part so much skill in the display of malice and so much perseverance in the art of tormenting that I cannot but respect his ingenuity and capacity And indeed if instead of an evil genius he had represented a guardian angel he could not have shewn a more refined taste in his choice of an object to hover about
You look as gay and as brisk as if fresh from the hay-field after only half a day’s work Pray how is it you pretty lasses find employment for the winter
How true is it yet how inconsistent that while we all desire to live long we have all an horror of being old The figure now passing is not meant to ridicule any particular person nor to stigmatize any particular absurdity its sole view is to expose to contempt and derision the general and natural infirmities of age and the design is not more disgusting than impolitic for why while so carefully we guard from all approaches of death should we close the only avenues to happiness in long life respect and tenderness
Fear not he is an evil spirit and we will surely lay him If one spell fails we must try another
You told me you knew him has he any right to follow you
We shall at least fortify you from any other assailant no three-headed Cerberus could protect you more effectually but you will not therefore fancy yourself in the lower regions for if I mistake not the torment of three guardians is nothing new to you
No you will find me as inoffensive as the hue of the domino I wear  and would I could add as insensible
Do you not know 
Did your late uncle chuse for two of your guardians Mr Harrel and Mr Briggs to give you an early lesson upon the opposite errors of profusion and meanness
No for my happiness I knew him not
Perhaps so but I fear I should have found the good he dispensed through his niece not quite unmixed with evil
Pray look at that figure of Hope is there any in the room half so expressive of despondency
O for a Midas to return to this leather-eared god the disgrace he received from him
Do you think then more highly of Mr Briggs for discernment and taste than of any body
The commission with which he is charged has then misled me I imagined discernment and taste might be necessary ingredients for making such a choice as your approbation would sanctify but perhaps his skill in guarding against any fraud or deduction in the stipulation he mentioned may be all that is requisite for the execution of his trust
My meaning should I express it seriously would but prove to you the respect and admiration with which you have inspired me and if indeed as Mr Briggs hinted such a prize is to be purchased by riches I know not from what I have seen of its merit any sum I should think adequate to its value
The conflict at the door will quite overpower you Stay here but a few minutes and both parties will have struggled themselves tired and you may then go without difficulty Mean time can you not by this faint light suppose me one of your guardians Mr Briggs for example or if he is too old for me Mr Harrel and entrust yourself to my care
Nor can I imagine how Mr Briggs became so particularly your favourite as to be entrusted with powers to dispose of you
But how has Mr Delvile offended you that with him only you seem to have no commerce or communication
He is certainly a man of fashion and he is also a man of honour surely then he would be more pleasant for confidence and consultation than one whose only notion of happiness is money whose only idea of excellence is avarice and whose only conception of sense is distrust
You think perhaps I shall never be gone And indeed I am almost of the same opinion but what can I do Instead of growing weary by the length of my stay my reluctance to shorten it encreases with its duration and all the methods I take whether by speaking to you or looking at you with a view to be satiated only double my eagerness for looking and listening again I must go however and if I am happy I may perhaps meet with you again  though if I am wise I shall never seek you more

For shame for shame gentlemen is this a place for such violence
Be not alarmed madam all is over and every body is safe
I am in doubt whether the efforts I make to revive will please or irritate you but though you rejected the last cordial I ventured to present you perhaps you will look with a more favourable eye towards that of which I am now the herald
Which ever of them is most honoured by this anxiety will be mad indeed to risk a life so valued
Ah madam those French beads and Bristol stones have not I find shone in vain
If Mr Briggs does not speedily come forth with his plum friend before the glittering of swords and spears is joined to that of jewels the glare will be so resplendent that he will fear to come within the influence of its rays Though perhaps he may only think the stronger the light the better he shall see to count his guineas for as 
   in ten thousand pounds 
Ten thousand charms are centred
in an hundred thousand the charms may have such magic power that he may defy the united efforts of tinsel and knight-errantry to deliver you from the golden spell

when I had the honour of seeing you last night at the Opera-house the dispute which had just happened between two gentlemen seemed to give you an uneasiness which could not but be painful to all who observed it and as among that number I was not the least moved you will forgive I hope my eagerness to be the first to bring you intelligence that nothing fatal has happened or is likely to happen
I find You now expect too much but hope is never so elastic as when it springs from the ruins of terror
Yes perfectly safe but I cannot tell you they have never been in danger
You oblige me madam by the honour of your commands I saw but too much reason to apprehend that measures the most violent would follow the affray of last night yet as I found that the quarrel had been accidental and the offence unpremeditated I thought it not absolutely impossible that an expeditious mediation might effect a compromise at least it was worth trying for though wrath slowly kindled or long nourished is sullen and intractable the sudden anger that has not had time to impress the mind with a deep sense of injury will when gently managed be sometimes appeased with the same quickness it is excited I hoped therefore that some trifling concession from Sir Robert as the aggressor 
Not by me I must own but I was not willing to think of the difficulty and therefore ventured to make the proposal nor did I leave the Opera-house till I had used every possible argument to persuade Sir Robert an apology would neither stain his courage nor his reputation But his spirit brooked not the humiliation
That I believe took him very little time to decide I discovered by means of a gentleman at the Opera who was acquainted with him where he lived and I waited upon him with an intention to offer my services towards settling the affair by arbitration for since you call him poor Mr Belfield I think you will permit me without offence to his antagonist to own that his gallantry though too impetuous for commendation engaged me in his interest
Whatever I may have thought I certainly did not wish that a sympathy offensive and defensive had been concluded between you I could not however gain access to Mr Belfield last night but the affair dwelt upon my mind and this morning I called at his lodging as soon as it was light
So valourous a Don Quixote certainly merited a faithful Esquire he was however gone out and nobody knew whither About half an hour ago I called upon him again he was then just returned home
I saw him the affair was over and in a short time he will be able if you will allow him so much honour to thank you for these enquiries
He is a little hurt but Sir Robert is perfectly safe Belfield fired first and missed the Baronet was not so successless
The ball entered his right side and the moment he felt it he fired his second pistol in the air This I heard from his servant He was brought home carefully and slowly no surgeon had been upon the spot but one was called to him immediately I stayed to enquire his opinion after the wound had been dressed he told me he had extracted the ball and assured me Mr Belfield was not in any danger Your alarm madam last night which had always been present to me then encouraged me to take the liberty of waiting upon you for I concluded you could yet have had no certain intelligence and thought it best to let the plain and simple fact out-run the probable exaggeration of rumour
Had my father known the honour I have had this morning of waiting upon Miss Beverley I am sure I should have been charged with his compliments and such a commission would somewhat have lessened the presumption of this visit but I feared lest while I should be making interest for my credentials the pretence of my embassy might be lost and other couriers less scrupulous might obtain previous audiences and anticipate my dispatches
Yes Sir I have more than once had that happiness but I have never had the honour of being introduced to her
Yes Sir I have more than once had that happiness but I have never had the honour of being introduced to her
My father has left me an office which could I execute it as perfectly as I shall willingly would be performed without a fault
You can only be a restraint upon me by commanding me from your presence I breakfasted long ago and am now just come from Mr Belfield I had the pleasure this morning of being admitted into his room
Not so well I fear as he thinks himself but he was in high spirits and surrounded by his friends whom he was entertaining with all the gaiety of a man in full health and entirely at his ease though I perceived by the frequent changes of his countenance signs of pain and indisposition that made me however pleased with his conversation think it necessary to shorten my own visit and to hint to those who were near me the propriety of leaving him quiet
No but he told me he should only have one dressing more of his wound and then get rid of the whole business by running into the country
No not at all but the little I have seen of him has strongly interested me in his favour at Mr Harrel’s masquerade where I first met with him I was extremely entertained by his humour though there perhaps as I had also the honour of first seeing Miss Beverley I might be too happy to feel much difficulty in being pleased And even at the Opera he had the advantage of finding me in the same favourable disposition as I had long distinguished you before I had taken any notice of him I must however confess I did not think his anger that evening quite without provocation but I beg your pardon I may perhaps be mistaken and you who know the whole affair must undoubtedly be better able to account for what happened
And do you madam judge of this matter with such severity
With candour alas then poor Sir Robert Severity were not half so bad a sign for him
What a claim is this upon the benevolence of Miss Beverley for if she has not now the indulgence by frequent and diligent visits to make some reparation she must consider herself as responsible for the dissention she will occasion
Not only her minority but her maturity and not only her maturity but her decline of life will pass I hope not merely without reproach but with fame and applause
Belfield Sir
They have taken then a very extraordinary method to prove their indifference
And to me almost every thing he has wit spirit and understanding talents to create admiration and qualities I believe to engage esteem
Not enough perhaps to coolly justify my praise but he is one of those whose first appearance takes the mind by surprise and leaves the judgment to make afterwards such terms as it can Will you madam when he is recovered permit me to introduce him to you
I know not Sir how Mr Belfield deserves to be called an adventurer he is not indeed rich but he is in a profession where parts such as his seldom fail to acquire riches however as to me his wealth can be of no consequence why should my regard to him wait for it if he is a young man of worth and honour  
It is for me to beg pardon of Miss Beverley for having occasioned them but when she is so good as to honour us with her company again I hope I shall have more discretion
Yes madam twice
I thought and I think still that your enquiries ought to be his cure
You must not however blame those messengers whose artifice has only had your satisfaction in view nor should I be so malignant as to blast their designs if I did not fear that Mr Belfield’s actual safety may be endangered by your continued deception
Ah madam what danger indeed is there that any man would not risk to give birth to such solicitude Mr Belfield however I believe is in none from which a command of yours cannot rescue him
You must order him to give up for the present his plan of going into the country where he can have no assistance and where his wound must be dressed only by a common servant and to remain quietly in town till his surgeon pronounces that he may travel without any hazard
Nothing less than such an intention could have induced me to undeceive you with respect to his recovery But indeed I am no friend to those artifices which purchase present relief by future misery I venture therefore to speak to you the simple truth that by a timely exertion of your influence you may prevent further evil
It is possible I may have been too much alarmed but in such a case as this no information ought to be depended upon but that of his surgeon You madam may probably know his opinion
I purpose calling upon him to-morrow morning will Miss Beverley permit me afterwards the honour of communicating to her what may pass
Why indeed you have not much right to be angry since it was your own frankness that excited mine And thus you find like most other culprits I am ready to cast the blame of the offence upon the offended I feel however an irresistible propensity to do service to Mr Belfield shall I sin quite beyond forgiveness if I venture to tell you how I found him situated this morning 
I found him then surrounded by a set of gay young men who by way of keeping up his spirits made him laugh and talk without ceasing he assured me himself that he was perfectly well and intended to gallop out of town to-morrow morning though when I shook hands with him at parting I was both shocked and alarmed to feel by the burning heat of the skin that far from discarding his surgeon he ought rather to call in a physician
That I pretend not to settle In stating the case I have satisfied my conscience and if in hearing it you can pardon the liberty I have taken I shall as much honour the openness of your character as I admire that of your countenance
Miss Beverley
Will you not first tell me what news you have heard
You will only then laugh at me for those officious offers you did so well to reject
They were indeed superfluous and therefore I wonder not you have forgotten them Shall I tell the chairmen whither to go
To Mr Briggs O live for ever French beads and Bristol stones fresh offers may perhaps be made there impertinent officious and useless as mine
Again surely some good genius is at work for me this morning
Indeed and was that the purpose for which you stood up
None surely but the accident was singularly opportune
How should you understand what is so little intelligible
Whence is it that young ladies even such whose principles are most strict seem universally in those affairs where their affections are concerned to think hypocrisy necessary and deceit amiable and hold it graceful to disavow to-day what they may perhaps mean publicly to acknowledge to-morrow 
Do you so much wonder that I should have hoped in Miss Beverley to have seen some deviation from such rules and have expected more openness and candour in a young lady who has given so noble a proof of the liberality of her mind and understanding
Must I speak yet more plainly and if I do will you bear to hear me
And may I tell you what has charmed me as well as what I have presumed to wonder at
Forgive then the frankness you invite and let me acknowledge to you how greatly I honour the nobleness of your conduct Surrounded as you are by the opulent and the splendid unshackled by dependance unrestrained by authority blest by nature with all that is attractive by situation with all that is desirable to slight the rich and disregard the powerful for the purer pleasure of raising oppressed merit and giving to desert that wealth in which alone it seemed deficient how can a spirit so liberal be sufficiently admired or a choice of so much dignity be too highly extolled
Pardon me then if here I return to my first question whence is it that a young lady who can think so nobly and act so disinterestedly should not be uniformly great simple in truth and unaffected in sincerity Why should she be thus guarded where frankness would do her so much honour Why blush in owning what all others may blush in envying
And why Madam would you tempt me to be more impertinent have I not said strange things already
Pardon then and forget them all I scarce know myself what urged me to say them but I began inadvertently without intending to go on and I have proceeded involuntarily without knowing how to stop The fault however is ultimately your own for the sight of you creates an insurmountable desire to converse with you and your conversation a propensity equally incorrigible to take some interest in your welfare
A happy conjecture but so wild a one I cannot but marvel how it should occur to you
How good is Miss Beverley thus to visit the sick and how much better might I have had the pleasure of seeing Mr Belfield had I but by prescience known her design and deferred my own enquiries till he had been revived by hers
I wish much to apologize to Miss Beverley before her departure for the very gross mistake of which I have been guilty I know not if it is possible she can pardon me and I hardly know myself by what perversity and blindness I persisted so long in my error
This is being candid indeed and in truth though your anxiety was obvious its cause was obscure and where any thing is left to conjecture opinion interferes and the judgment is easily warped My own partiality however for Mr Belfield will I hope plead my excuse as from that and not from any prejudice against the Baronet my mistake arose on the contrary so highly I respect your taste and your discernment that your approbation when known can scarcely fail of securing mine
Is it possible  but no it is not possible I should be again mistaken I forbore to speak at all till I had information by which I could not be misled
I already think you very strange so strange that I know not any one who at all resembles you But what is this consultation in which you will permit me to have a voice
I am and I think his situation the most melancholy that can be imagined I pity him with my whole soul and nothing would give me greater joy than an opportunity of serving him
There is no man who might not rather envy than pity sufferings which give rise to such compassion
How do I rejoice in this flattering concurrence of our opinions see madam how I have been this very morning occupied in endeavouring to procure for Mr Belfield some employment by which his education might be rendered useful and his parts redound to his own credit and advantage
As the son of a brother guardian I think I have a kind of claim to his acquaintance
Why what a little thief you are to run away from us thus what do you think Sir Robert will say I saw him looking for you at the very instant of your flight
Will you give me leave to repeat this to my Lord Ernolf
And if I should half of it at least would thank me and to obtain the applause of so noble an assembly what would it signify that Sir Robert should cut my throat
And is it possible that such can be your opinion and yet situated as you are the whole world at your command and all mankind at your devotion  but I am answering you seriously when you are only speaking by rule
That which young ladies upon certain occasions always prescribe themselves
And whence comes it that you partake so little of these delights
There is something I must own rather unknightly in quitting the field for a wet jacket but the company I hope will only give me credit for flying away to Ranelagh So 
Like a brave general after being beat 
I’ll exult and rejoice in a prudent retreat
Is it possible Miss Beverley that I should twice have been thus egregiously deceived or rather that the whole town and even the most intimate of your friends should so unaccountably have persisted in a mistake
Pardon me it was from one who ought to know that I had myself the intelligence
Mr Harrel himself who communicated it to a lady in my hearing and at a public place
Even yet I can scarcely feel undeceived your engagement seemed so positive your connexion so irretrievable so  so fixed I mean  Yet whence if to neither favourable if indifferent alike to Sir Robert and to Belfield whence that animated apprehension for their safety at the Opera-house whence that never to be forgotten oh stop him good God will nobody stop him Words of anxiety so tender and sounds that still vibrate in my ear
You are then at liberty  Ah madam how many may rue so dangerous a discovery
Oh no far otherwise a thousand times I have wondered at his happiness a thousand times when I have looked at you and listened to you I have thought it impossible yet my authority seemed indisputable And how was I to discredit what was not uttered as a conjecture but asserted as a fact asserted too by the guardian with whom you lived and not hinted as a secret but affirmed as a point settled
No I never supposed any mistake though sometimes I thought you repented your engagement I concluded indeed you had been unwarily drawn in and I have even at times been tempted to acknowledge my suspicions to you state your independence and exhort you  as a friend exhort you to use it with spirit and if you were shackled unwillingly incautiously or unworthily to break the chains by which you were confined and restore to yourself that freedom of choice upon the use of which all your happiness must ultimately depend But I doubted if this were honourable to the Baronet and what indeed was my right to such a liberty none that every man might not be proud of a wish to do honour to myself under the officious pretence of serving the most amiable of women
If Sir Robert is himself deceived while he deceives others who can forbear to pity him for my own part instead of repining that hitherto I have been mistaken ought I not rather to bless an error that may have been my preservative from danger
It is not indeed well timed just now at the moment when  
Oh dangerous interval 
Do I frighten you away 
I fear I have strangely exposed myself  and that you cannot but the extreme astonishment  
you will permit me to attend you to the chair
No pray let it be discussed now
Yes as well as one who having ever hoped your favour can easily be after finding that hope disappointed But much as she has taught her son there is one lesson she might perhaps learn from him to fly not seek those dangerous indulgences of which the deprivation is the loss of peace
Mr Belfield’s merit has not been thrown away upon Lord Vannelt he has heard an excellent character of him from all his former acquaintance and is now fitting up an apartment for him in his own house till his son begins his tour
You have seen Mr Belfield’s sister
She is very amiable too amiable indeed for her situation since her relations her brother alone excepted are all utterly unworthy of her
Perhaps you do not think her amiable  you may have seen more of her and know something to her disadvantage
No but when I have been with Mr Belfield some of them have called upon him
I have been greatly pleased by being informed of your goodness to her and I think she seems equally to require and to deserve it I doubt not you will extend it to her when she is deprived of her brother for then will be the time that by doing her most service it will reflect on yourself most honour
Safe Madam yes I hope so has any thing endangered your safety
Protect you yes while I live but what is the matter why are you so pale are you ill are you frightened what is the matter
Heard what I am but this moment arrived my mother grew uneasy that she did not see you she sent to your house and was told that you were not returned from Vauxhall some other circumstances also alarmed her and therefore late as it was I came hither myself The instant I entered this place I saw you here This is all my history tell me now yours Where is your party where are Mr and Mrs Harrel Why are you alone
Amiable Miss Beverley what a dreadful scene have you witnessed what a cruel task have you nobly performed such spirit with such softness so much presence of mind with such feeling but you are all excellence human nature can rise no higher I believe indeed you are its most perfect ornament
Pardon me for this intrusion but tell me is it impossible that in this affair I can represent my father may not the office you meant for him devolve upon me remember how near we are to each other and honour me for once with supposing us the same
You must not deny me where is the packet why should you lose a moment
And what can I risk half so precious as your smallest satisfaction do you suppose I can flatter myself with a possibility of contributing to it and yet have the resolution to refuse myself so much pleasure no no the heroic times are over and self-denial is no longer in fashion
No matter for what has passed we are now to think of what is to come I know you too well to doubt your impatience in the execution of a commission which circumstances have rendered sacred and should any thing either be done or omitted contrary to the directions in your packet will you not be apt blameless as you are to disturb yourself with a thousand fears that you took not proper methods for the discharge of your trust
Come then Miss Beverley let us wait no longer I will see you home and then return to Lady Honoria
It is more precious than the air I breathe
How could a thousand Lady Honoria’s recompence the world for the loss of one Miss Beverley we may indeed find many thousand such as Lady Honoria but such as Miss Beverley where shall we ever find another
Let us then stop and rest but why will you not lean upon me surely this is no time for scruples and for idle and unnecessary scruples Miss Beverley can never find a time
sweet lovely burthen O why not thus for ever
pardon me Cecilia Madam Miss Beverley I mean 
What would I not do to obtain forgiveness from Miss Beverley
Do you command it
Ah whose are the commands that would have half the weight with your wishes
do you forgive me
All sweetness is Miss Beverley O that I had power that it were not utterly impossible that the cruelty of my situation  
Will you not let me carry it for you 
I am grieved to find you thus offended but were it possible you could know half the wretchedness of my heart the generosity of your own would make you regret this severity
Were I to send for a physician Sir he would find it much more difficult to imagine what advice to give me
Your ladyship made so great a coward of me that I ran away from shame at my own inferiority of courage
O Lady Honoria was such a Heroine that she wholly disdained receiving any assistance her valour was so much more undaunted than mine that she ventured to brave the lightning under an oak tree
I had the honour to wait upon Miss Beverley to the little gate and I was then returning to Lady Honoria when I met her ladyship just coming in
I believe Dr Lyster you little expected to meet a patient who were he as skilful would be as able to do business as yourself
Miss Beverley for three minutes only
Will you not even enter the same room with me
No madam you are the only person who could not disturb me since my employment was making memorandums for a letter to yourself with which however I did not desire to importune you but that you have denied me the honour of even a five minutes audience
I should be sorry to quit this place especially as the length of my absence is extremely uncertain while I have the unhappiness to be under your displeasure without making some little attempt to apologize for the behaviour which incurred it Must I then finish my letter or will you at last deign to hear me
I meant not madam to infer that the subject or indeed that the object merited your deliberate attention I simply wish to explain what may have appeared mysterious in my conduct and for what may have seemed still more censurable to beg your pardon
This indulgence madam deserves my most grateful acknowledgments it is indeed what I had little right and still less reason after the severity I have met with from you to expect
That severity however I mean not to lament on the contrary in a situation such as mine it was perhaps the first blessing I could receive I have found from it indeed more advantage and relief than from all that philosophy reflection or fortitude could offer It has shewn me the vanity of bewailing the barrier placed by fate to my wishes since it has shewn me that another less inevitable but equally insuperable would have opposed them I have determined therefore after a struggle I must confess the most painful to deny myself the dangerous solace of your society and endeavour by joining dissipation to reason to forget the too great pleasure which hitherto it has afforded me
Ah madam he jests at scars who never felt a wound but this is a strain in which I have no right to talk and I will neither offend your delicacy nor my own integrity by endeavouring to work upon the generosity of your disposition in order to excite your compassion Not such was the motive with which I begged this audience but merely a desire before I tear myself away to open to you my heart without palliation or reserve
Long before I had the honour of your acquaintance your character and your accomplishments were known to me Mr Biddulph of Suffolk who was my first friend at Oxford and with whom my intimacy is still undiminished was early sensible of your excellencies we corresponded and his letters were filled with your praises He confessed to me that his admiration had been unfortunate alas I might now make the same confession to him
When Mr Harrel saw masks in Portman-square my curiosity to behold a lady so adored and so cruel led me thither your dress made you easily distinguished Ah Miss Beverley I venture not to mention what I then felt for my friend I will only say that something which I felt for myself warned me instantly to avoid you since the clause in your uncle’s will was already well known to me
This warning I should not have disregarded had I not at the Opera been deceived into a belief you were engaged I then wished no longer to shun you bound in honour to forbear all efforts at supplanting a man to whom I thought you almost united I considered you already as married and eagerly as I sought your society I sought it not with more pleasure than innocence Yet even then to be candid I found in myself a restlessness about your affairs that kept me in eternal perturbation but I flattered myself it was mere curiosity and only excited by the perpetual change of opinion to which occasion gave rise concerning which was the happy man
I will not madam fatigue you by tracing the progress of my unfortunate admiration I will endeavour to be more brief for I see you are already wearied 
I knew not the warmth with which I honoured your virtues till you deigned to plead to me for Mr Belfield but let me not recollect the feelings of that moment yet were they nothing cold languid lifeless to what I afterwards experienced when you undeceived me finally with respect to your situation and informed me the report concerning Sir Robert Floyer was equally erroneous with that which concerned Belfield O what was the agitation of my whole soul at that instant to know you disengaged to see you before me by the disorder of my whole frame to discover the mistake I had cherished 
Pardon me madam I will have done and trace my feelings and my sufferings no longer but hasten for my own sake as well as yours to the reason why I have spoken at all From the hour that my ill-destined passion was fully known to myself I weighed all the consequences of indulging it and found added to the extreme hazard of success an impropriety even in the attempt My honour in the honour of my family is bound what to that would seem wrong in me would be unjustifiable yet where inducements so numerous were opposed by one single objection where virtue beauty education and family were all unexceptionable Oh cruel clause barbarous and repulsive clause that forbids my aspiring to the first of women but by an action that with my own family would degrade me for ever
I see madam your eagerness to be gone and however at this moment I may lament it I shall recollect it hereafter with advantage But to conclude I determined to avoid you and by avoiding to endeavour to forget you I determined also that no human being and yourself least of all should know should even suspect the situation of my mind and though upon various occasions my prudence and forbearance have suddenly yielded to surprise and to passion the surrender has been short and almost I believe unnoticed
This silence and this avoidance I sustained with decent constancy till during the storm in an ill-fated moment I saw or thought I saw you in some danger and then all caution off guard all resolution surprised every passion awake and tenderness triumphant   
Alas I know not I thought myself better qualified for this conference and meant to be firm and concise I have told my story ill but as your own understanding will point out the cause your own benevolence will perhaps urge some excuse
Too certain since that unfortunate accident that all disguise was vain and convinced by your displeasure of the impropriety of which I had been guilty I determined as the only apology I could offer to open to you my whole heart and then fly you perhaps for ever
This madam incoherently indeed yet with sincerity I have now done my sufferings and my conflicts I do not mention for I dare not O were I to paint to you the bitter struggles of a mind all at war with itself Duty spirit and fortitude combating love happiness and inclination each conquering alternately and alternately each vanquished I could endure it no longer I resolved by one effort to finish the strife and to undergo an instant of even exquisite torture in preference to a continuance of such lingering misery
Since I fancy it has been injured what a phrase after an avowal such as mine But why should I wish to convince you of my sincerity when to you it cannot be more indifferent than to myself it is unfortunate I have now only to entreat your pardon for the robbery I have committed upon your time and to repeat my acknowledgments that you have endeavoured to hear me with patience
Nor do I presume madam to detain you hitherto you may frequently have thought me mysterious sometimes strange and capricious and perhaps almost always unmeaning to clear myself from these imputations by a candid confession of the motives which have governed me is all that I wished Once also I hope but once you thought me impertinent there indeed I less dare vindicate myself 
Barbarous and insulting Go madam go and be your happiness unalterable as your inflexibility
Miss Beverley here and alone and does she not fly as I approach her can she patiently bear in her sight one so strange so fiery so inconsistent But she is too wise to resent the ravings of a madman and who under the influence of a passion at once hopeless and violent can boast but at intervals full possession of his reason
I am ashamed indeed of the bitterness of spirit with which I last night provoked your displeasure when I should have supplicated your lenity but though I was prepared for your coldness I could not endure it and though your indifference was almost friendly it made me little less than frantic so strangely may justice be blinded by passion and every faculty of reason be warped by selfishness
You may well dispense with my apologies since under the sanction of that word I obtained your hearing yesterday But believe me you will now find me far more reasonable a whole night’s reflections   reflections which no repose interrupted have brought me to my senses Even lunatics you know have lucid moments
I believe so I wait only for my father But why is Miss Beverley so impatient I shall not soon return that at least is certain and for a few instants delay may surely offer some palliation  See if I am not ready to again accuse you of severity I must run I find or all my boasted reformation will end but in fresh offence fresh disgrace and fresh contrition Adieu madam and may all prosperity attend you That will be ever my darling wish however long my absence however distant the climates which may part us
Yes for why should I remain in it a few weeks only could I fill up in any tour so near home and hither in a few weeks to return would be folly and madness in an absence so brief what thought but that of the approaching meeting would occupy me and what at that meeting should I feel but joy the most dangerous and delight which I dare not think of every conflict renewed every struggle re-felt again all this scene would require to be acted again I must tear myself away and every tumultuous passion now beating in my heart would be revived and if possible be revived with added misery No neither my temper nor my constitution will endure such another shock one parting shall suffice and the fortitude with which I will lengthen my self-exile shall atone to myself for the weakness which makes it requisite
Two thousand two million What is it Miss Beverley will condescend to command
Generous and humane is the consideration but who half so generous so humane as Miss Beverley so soft to all others so noble in herself Can my mother have a wish when I leave her with you No she is sensible of your worth she adores you almost as I adore you myself you are now under her protection you seem indeed born for each other let me not then deprive her of so honourable a charge –Oh why must he who sees in such colours the excellencies of both who admires with such fervour the perfections you unite be torn with this violence from the objects he reveres even though half his life he would sacrifice to spend in their society what remained  
Will you not wish me a good journey
And will you pardon the unguarded errors which have offended you
Farewell then most amiable of women and may every blessing you deserve light on your head I leave to you my mother certain of your sympathetic affection for a character so resembling your own When you madam leave her may the happy successor in your favour  
O great be your felicity in whatever way you receive it pure as your virtues and warm as your benevolence Oh too lovely Miss Beverley why why must I quit you
Yes dear Fidel you have a claim indeed to my attention and with the fondest gratitude will I cherish you ever
Is this possible am I not in a dream Good God is it indeed possible
No loveliest Miss Beverley not thus must we now part this moment only have I discovered what a treasure I was leaving and but for Fidel I had quitted it in ignorance for ever
O kind Lady Honoria how shall I ever thank her And did she also tell you to caress and to cherish him to talk to him of his master  
Come dear Fidel come and plead for your master come and ask in his name who now has a proud heart whose pride now is invincible
Ever-lovely Miss Beverley why this resentment why all this causeless distress Has not my heart long since been known to you have you not witnessed its sufferings and been assured of its tenderness why then this untimely reserve this unabating coldness Oh why try to rob me of the felicity you have inadvertently given me and to sour the happiness of a moment that recompenses such exquisite misery
You blame me too soon your own friend Mrs Charlton permitted me to come hither in search of you then indeed when I heard the sound of your voice when I heard that voice talk of Fidel of his master  
Why will you talk thus my beloved Miss Beverley what have you done what let me ask have I done that such infinite disgrace and depression should follow this little sensibility to a passion so fervent Does it not render you more dear to me than ever does it not add new life new vigour to the devotion by which I am bound to you
Good heaven what strange apprehensions thus terrify you are you with me less safe than with yourself is it my honour you doubt is it my integrity you fear Surely I cannot be so little known to you and to make protestations now would but give a new alarm to a delicacy already too agitated Else would I tell you that more sacred than my life will I hold what I have heard that the words just now graven on my heart shall remain there to eternity unseen and that higher than ever not only in my love but my esteem is the beautiful speaker 
No she is raised she is exalted I find her more excellent and perfect than I had even dared believe her I discover new virtues in the spring of every action I see what I took for indifference was dignity I perceive what I imagined the most rigid insensibility was nobleness was propriety was true greatness of mind
Ah were I to praise as I think of you were my language permitted to accord with my opinion of your worth you would not then simply call me a flatterer you would tell me I was an idolator and fear at least for my principles if not for my understanding
Will you suffer me then to see you early to-morrow morning
Does Miss Beverley then think me capable of desiring to see her for mere selfish gratification of intending to trifle either with her time or her feelings no the conference I desire will be important and decisive This night I shall devote solely to deliberation tomorrow shall be given to action Without some thinking I dare venture at no plan I presume not to communicate to you the various interests that divide me but the result of them all I can take no denial to your hearing
True I must go the longer I stay the more I am fascinated and the weaker are those reasoning powers of which I now want the strongest exertion
At Bristol no have you never heard she is returned to Delvile-Castle
She had not I believe any occasion to try them
How vain is every plan which passes the present hour 
when we parted yesterday I presumed to say one night alone should be given to deliberation and to-day this very day to action but I forgot that though in deliberating I had only myself to consult in acting I was not so independent and that when my own doubts were satisfied and my own resolutions taken other doubts and other resolutions must be considered by which my purposed proceedings might be retarded might perhaps be wholly prevented
Upon you madam all that is good or evil of my future life as far as relates to its happiness or misery will from this very hour almost solely depend yet much as I rely upon your goodness and superior as I know you to trifling or affectation what I now come to propose to petition to entreat I cannot summon courage to mention from a dread of alarming you
Is Miss Beverley determined not to speak to me Is she bent upon silence only to intimidate me Indeed if she knew how greatly I respect her she would honour me with more confidence
Never unless banished by you never no loveliest Miss Beverley I can now quit you no more Fortune beauty worth and sweetness I had power to relinquish and severe as was the task I compelled myself to perform it but when to these I find joined so attractive a softness a pity for my sufferings so unexpectedly gentle   no sweetest Miss Beverley I can quit you no more 
I here offer you my vows I here own you sole arbitress of my fate I give you not merely the possession of my heart that indeed I had no power to with-hold from you but I give you the direction of my conduct I entreat you to become my counsellor and guide Will Miss Beverley accept such an office Will she deign to listen to such a prayer
O how malicious yet not so immediately do I even request your counsel something must first be done to qualify you for giving it penetration skill and understanding however amply you possess them are not sufficient to fit you for the charge something still more is requisite you must be invested with fuller powers you must have a right less disputable and a title that not alone inclination not even judgment alone must sanctify but which law must enforce and rites the most solemn support
Resent not my presumption my beloved Miss Beverley but let the severity of my recent sufferings palliate my present temerity for where affliction has been deep and serious causeless and unnecessary misery will find little encouragement and mine has been serious indeed Sweetly then permit me in proportion to its bitterness to rejoice in the soft reverse which now flatters me with its approach
Oh how transient is human felicity How rapidly fly those rare and exquisite moments in which it is perfect Ah Sweetest Miss Beverley what words shall I find to soften what I have now to reveal to tell you that after goodness candour generosity such as yours a request a supplication remains yet to be uttered that banishes me if refused from your presence for ever
I knew too well how much you would be alarmed and such was my dread of your displeasure that it had power even to embitter the happiness I sought with so much earnestness and to render your condescension insufficient to ensure it Yet wonder not at my scheme wild as it may appear it is the result of deliberation and censurable as it may seem it springs not from unworthy motives
You wrong me cruelly and a moment’s reflection must tell you that however distinct may be our honour or our disgrace in every other instance in that by which we should be united they must inevitably be the same and far sooner would I voluntarily relinquish you than be myself accessary to tainting that delicacy of which the unsullied purity has been the chief source of my admiration
Circumstances the most singular and necessity the most unavoidable should alone have ever tempted me to form it No longer ago than yesterday morning I believed my self incapaple of even wishing it but extraordinary situations call for extraordinary resolutions and in private as well as public life palliate at least extraordinary actions Alas the proposal which so much offends you is my final resource it is the sole barrier between myself and perpetual misery the only expedient in my power to save me from eternally parting with you for I am now cruelly compelled to confess that my family I am certain will never consent to our union
I dare assure you hasty you may perhaps think me and somewhat impetuous I cannot deny myself but believe me not of so wretched a character as to be capable in any affair of moment of fickleness or caprice
Cruel Miss Beverley how unjust is this inference If yesterday I disapproved what to-day I recommend a little recollection must surely tell you why and that not my opinion but my situation is changed
Have you not yourself witnessed the steadiness of my mind Have you not beheld me fly when I had power to pursue and avoid when I had opportunity to seek you After witnessing my constancy upon such trying occasions is it equitable is it right to suspect me of wavering
Have a care half smiling and taking a letter from his pocket have a care upon this point how you provoke me to shew my justification
No upon my honour The authority is less doubtful I believe I should hardly else have regarded it
Good heaven what has thus affected you Can the jealous surmises of an apprehensive rival ¬¬ ¬¬  ¬¬
I will go I will obey you in every thing tell me but when I may return and when you will suffer me to explain to you all the motives of my proposal
Disdains No you are revered in it who could disdain you That fatal clause alone ¬¬ ¬¬
I am gone this moment I would not even wish to take advantage of your agitation in order to work upon your sensibility My desire is not to surprize but to reconcile you to my plan What is it I seek in Miss Beverley An Heiress No as such she has seen I could resist her nor yet the light trifler of a spring or two neglected when no longer a novelty no no ¬¬it is a companion for ever it is a solace for every care it is a bosom friend through every period of life that I seek in Miss Beverley Her esteem therefore to me is as precious as her affection for how can I hope her friendship in the winter of my days if their brighter and gayer season is darkened by doubts of my integrity All shall be clear and explicit no latent cause of uneasiness shall disturb our future quiet we will now be sincere that hereafter we may be easy and sweetly in unclouded felicity time shall glide away imperceptibly and we will make an interest with each other in the gaiety of youth to bear with the infirmities of age and alleviate them by kindness and sympathy And then shall my soothing Cecilia ¬¬
You are probably acquainted madam with the purport of the letter I had the honour of sending to Miss Beverley this morning
I know madam what they have to say for their language and their principles have been invariable from my birth to apply to them therefore for a concession which I am certain they will not grant were only a cruel device to lay all my misery to their account
To mock their authority would be more offensive than to oppose it to solicit their approbation and then act in defiance of it might justly provoke their indignation No if at last I am reduced to appeal to them by their decision I must abide
And is such also the opinion of Miss Beverley has she doomed me to be wretched and does she wish that doom to be signed by my nearest friends
To entreaty they will be inflexible but not to forgiveness My father though haughty dearly even passionately loves me my mother though high-spirited is just noble and generous She is indeed the most exalted of women and her power over my mind I am unaccustomed to resist Miss Beverley alone seems born to be her daughter  
She loves she adores you and were I not certain she feels your excellencies as they ought to be felt my veneration for you both should even yet spare you my present supplication But you would become I am certain the first blessing of her life in you she would behold all the felicity of her son his restoration to health to his country to his friends
O stop and resolve not till you have heard me Would you were she no more were my father also no more would you yet persist in refusing me
Oh make me not a monster force me not to desire the death of the very beings by whom I live weaken not the bonds of affection by which they are endeared to me and compel me not to wish them no more as the sole barriers to my happiness
Why then only upon their extinction must I rest my hope of your favour
Certainly but what of Miss Belfield that can raise a doubt in the mind of Miss Beverley
Is it possible you could ever for an instant suppose but I cannot even name a supposition so foreign to all possibility
Yes she is innocent gentle and engaging and I heartily wish she were in a better situation
Never in my life
Have a care lest I reverse the question and ask if your visits to the sister were not sometimes for the brother But what does this mean Could Miss Beverley imagine that after knowing her the charms of Miss Belfield could put me in any danger
Miss Belfield has I grant an attraction in the simplicity of her manners which charms by its singularity her heart too seems all purity and her temper all softness I have not you find been blind to her merit on the contrary I have both admired and pitied her But far indeed is she removed from all chance of rivalry in my heart A character such as hers for a while is irresistably alluring but when its novelty is over simplicity uninformed becomes wearisome and softness without dignity is too indiscriminate to give delight We sigh for entertainment when cloyed by mere sweetness and heavily drags on the load of life when the companion of our social hours wants spirit intelligence and cultivation With Miss Beverley all these   
But now that obstacle is surmounted
And why should I deceive you Why pretend to think with pleasure or even with indifference of an obstacle which has had thus long the power to make me miserable But where is happiness without allay Is perfect bliss the condition of humanity Oh if we refuse to taste it till in its last state of refinement how shall the cup of evil be ever from our lips
O Miss Beverley how have I merited this severity Did I make my proposals lightly Did I suffer my eagerness to conquer my reason Have I not on the contrary been steady and considerate neither biassed by passion nor betrayed by tenderness
The pride of heart which supported me there will support me no longer what sustained my firmness but your apparent severity What enabled me to fly you but your invariable coldness The rigour with which I trampled upon my feelings I thought fortitude and spirit but I knew not then the pitying sympathy of Cecilia
Impossible differently I thought of you but never better never so well as now I then represented you all lovely in beauty all perfect in goodness and virtue but it was virtue in its highest majesty not as now blended with the softest sensibility
No it is but more from the life it is the sublimity of an angel mingled with all that is attractive in woman But who is the friend we may venture to trust To whom may I give my bond And from whom may I receive a treasure which for the rest of my life will constitute all its felicity
You will find one in your own bosom ask but yourself this plain question will any virtue be offended by your honouring me with your hand
But is there no time for emancipation Am not I of an age to chuse for myself the partner of my life Will not you in a few days be the uncontrolled mistress of your actions Are we not both independant Your ample fortune all your own and the estates of my father so entailed they must unavoidably be mine
No but they are circumstances to relieve us from slavery Let me not offend you if I am still more explicit When no law human or divine can be injured by our union when one motive of pride is all that can be opposed to a thousand motives of convenience and happiness why should we both be made unhappy merely lest that pride should lose its gratification
Be mine sweetest Cecilia and all will go well To refer me to my friends is effectually to banish me for-ever Spare me then the unavailing task and save me from the resistless entreaties of a mother whose every desire I have held sacred whose wish has been my law and whose commands I have implicitly invariably obeyed Oh generously save me from the dreadful alternative of wounding her maternal heart by a preremptory refusal or of torturing my own with pangs to which it is unequal by an extorted obedience
And why once mine irrevocably mine   
Indeed you are mistaken to your merit they are far from insensible and your fortune is just what they wish Trust me therefore when I assure you that their displeasure which both respect and justice will guard them from ever shewing you will soon die wholly away I speak not merely from my hopes in judging my own friends I consider human nature in general Inevitable evils are ever best supported It is suspence it is hope that make the food of misery certainty is always endured because known to be past amendment and felt to give defiance to struggling
In a situation so extraordinary as ours there is no other The voice of the world at large will be all in our favour Our union neither injures our fortunes nor taints our morality with the character of each the other is satisfied and both must be alike exculpated from mercenary views of interest or romantic contempt of poverty what right have we then to repine at an objection which however potent is single Surely none Oh if wholly unchecked were the happiness I now have in view if no foul storm sometimes lowered over the prospect and for a moment obscured its brightness how could my heart find room for joy so superlative The whole world might rise against me as the first man in it who had nothing left to wish
Can you pardon an intrusion which was not in our bond But how could I wait till to-morrow when I knew you were in town to-night
Are you angry that I have ventured to come hither to night
No was it to forbid our meeting till to-morrow
However that may be Sir you did not I presume wait upon Miss Beverley to talk of me
What little dog Sir do you know what you are talking of
I made you drop him I believe Sir you had much better call some other time it does not appear to me that you are in a proper situation for remaining here at present
Come Sir if you please we will walk away together
I feared I had passed the time for admittance and the torture I have suffered from being detained has almost driven me wild I have been in misery to see you again   your looks your manner the letter you talk of all have filled me with alarm and though I know not what it is I have to dread I find it impossible to rest a moment without some explanation Tell me then why you seem thus strange and thus depressed Tell me what that letter was to forbid Tell me any thing and every thing but that you repent your condescension
Gracious heaven what is it you mean
Who has been with you to defame me in your opinion Who has barbarously wronged my character since I left you last Monday Mr Monckton received me coldly has he injured me in your esteem Tell tell me but to whom I owe this change that my vindication if it restores not your favour may at least make you cease to blush that once I was honoured with some share of it
And are you then unchanged and is your esteem for me still   
Never can I quit you without knowing it I would not linger till to-morrow in this suspence to be master of the universe
Recover then your peace for I here acquit you of all promise to fetter to compel you were too inhuman to afford me any happiness Yet hear me dispassionately hear me and deliberate a moment before you resolve upon my exile Your scruples I am not now going combat I grieve that they are so powerful but I have no new arguments with which to oppose them all I have to say is that it is now too late for a retreat to satisfy them
Suffer not however your delicacy for my family to make you forget what is due to yourself as well as to me the fear of shocking you led me just now to conceal what a greater fear now urges me to mention The honour I have had in view is already known to many and in a very short time there are none will be ignorant of it That impudent young man Morrice had the effrontery to rally me upon my passion for you and though I reproved him with great asperity he followed me into a coffee-house whither I went merely to avoid him There I forced myself to stay till I saw him engaged with a news-paper and then through various private streets and alleys I returned hither but judge my indignation when the moment I knocked at the door I perceived him again at my side
I angrily demanded what he meant by thus pursuing me he very submissively begged my pardon and said he had had a notion I should come back and had therefore only followed me to see if he was right I hesitated for an instant whether to chastise or confide in him but believing a few hours would make his impertinence immaterial I did neither the door opened and I came in
Now then weigh your objections against the consequences which must follow It is discovered I attended you in town it will be presumed I had your permission for such attendance to separate therefore now will be to no purpose with respect to that delicacy which makes you wish it It will be food for conjecture for enquiry for wonder almost while both our names are remembered and while to me it will bring the keenest misery in the severity of my disappointment it will cast over your own conduct a veil of mystery and obscurity wholly subversive of that unclouded openness that fair transparent ingenuousness by which it has hitherto been distinguished
You overwhelm me with grief by finding you thus distressed when I had hoped Oh cruel Cecilia how different to this did I hope to have met you all your doubts settled all your fears removed your mind perfectly composed and ready unreluctantly to ratify the promise with so much sweetness accorded me where now are those hopes  where now  
Tell me first and let good Mrs Charlton speak too ought not every objection to our union however potent to give way without further hesitation to the certainty that our intending it must become public Who that hears of our meeting in London at such a season in such circumstances and at such hours   
I must speak now or lose for-ever all that is dear to me and add to the misery of that loss the heart-piercing reflection of having injured her whom of all the world I most love most value and most revere
If any one has ever so lived as to dare defy it Miss Beverley is she but though safe by the established purity of your character from calumny there are other and scarce less invidious attacks from which no one is exempt and of which the refinement the sensibility of your mind will render you but the more susceptible ridicule has shafts and impertinence has arrows which though against innocence they may be levelled in vain have always the power of wounding tranquility
I will I will begone this very moment Tell me but first you will think of what I have said and refer me not to your letter but deign yourself to pronounce my doom when you have considered if it may not be softened
I go though I have yet a thousand things to propose and to supplicate and though still in a suspense that my temper knows ill how to endure but I should rather be rendered miserable than happy in merely overpowering your reason by entreaty I leave you therefore to your own reflections yet remember   and refuse not to remember with some compunction that all chance all possibility of earthly happiness for me depends upon your decision
You hesitate no more and is it possible  Oh my Cecilia is it possible your resolution is in my favour
Ere I take it then tell me if your reluctance has its origin in me that I may rather even yet relinquish you than merely owe your hand to the selfishness of persecution
The clergyman is waiting I have left him with Mr Singleton in the vestry no new objections have started and no new obstacles have intervened why then torment ourselves with discussing again the old ones which we have already considered till every possible argument upon them is exhausted Tranquilize I conjure you your agitated spirits and if the truest tenderness the most animated esteem and the gratefullest admiration can soften your future cares and ensure your future peace every anniversary of this day will recompense my Cecilia for every pang she now suffers
What can this mean
No Sir I did not even see her
Let me support you
Whither whither are you going
Why did you stop the ceremony Sir 
It has been wholly accidental for we neither of us know the woman who could not have any right or authority for the prohibition 
why do you thus move off Why leave the ceremony unfinished  Mrs Charlton what is it you are about Cecilia I beseech you return and let the service go on
This is insupportable turn I conjure you my Cecilia my wife why is it you thus abandon me  Turn I implore you and receive my eternal vows Mrs Charlton bring her back Cecilia you must not go 
Where where is this infamous woman This wretch who has thus wantonly destroyed me
I have pursued and enquired in vain I can neither discover nor hear of her But what is all this Whither are you going What does this coach do here   Mrs Charlton why do you get into it Cecilia what are you doing
You are mine you are my wife I will part with you no more and go whithersoever you will I will follow and claim you
Oh then rest on me rest but upon me till the ceremony is over  you will drive me to despair and to madness if you leave me in this barbarous manner
Inhuman Cecilia to desert me at the very altar to cast me off at the instant the most sacred rites were uniting us  and then thus to look at me to treat me with this disdain at a time of such distraction to scorn me thus injuriously at the moment you unjustly abandon me  
Oh heaven if any crime any offence of mine has occasioned this fatal blow the whole world holds not a wretch so culpable as myself nor one who will sooner allow the justice of your rigour my veneration for you has ever equalled my affection and could I think it was through me you have suffered any indignity I should soon abhor myself as you seem to abhor me But what is it I have done How have I thus incensed you By what action by what guilt have I incurred this displeasure
What an inference is this over me then do you conclude this woman had any power
Determined as you are to leave me indifferent to my peace and incredulous of my word deign at least before we part to be more explicit in your accusation and tell me if indeed it is possible you can suspect that the wretch who broke off the ceremony had ever from me received provocation for such an action 
You are right then madam to discard me to treat me with contempt to banish me without repugnance since I see you believe me capable of duplicity and imagine I am better informed in this affair than I appear to be You have said I shall make you miserable no madam no your happiness and misery depend not upon one you hold so worthless
This then Cecilia is your faith this is the felicity you bid me hope this is the recompense of my sufferings and the performance of your engagement
You are insensible to my misery and impenetrable to my entreaties a secret enemy has had power to make me odious in your sight though for her enmity I can assign no cause though even her existence was this morning unknown to me Ever ready to abandon and most willing to condemn me you have more confidence in a vague conjecture than in all you have observed of the whole tenour of my character Without knowing why you are disposed to believe me criminal without deigning to say wherefore you are eager to banish me your presence Yet scarce could a consciousness of guilt itself wound me so forcibly so keenly as you suspecting I am guilty
Shew but to them the smallest sensibility shew but for me the most distant concern and I will try to bear my disappointment without murmuring and submit to your decrees as to those from which there is no appeal but to wound without deigning even to look at what you destroy to shoot at random those arrows that are pointed with poison to see them fasten on the heart and corrode its vital functions yet look on without compunction or turn away with cold disdain Oh where is the candour I thought lodged in Cecilia where the justice the equity I believed a part of herself
Oh fatal prelude what on earth can quiet my mind that leads to our separation Give to me no condescension with any such view preserve your indifference persevere in your coldness triumph still in your power of inspiring those feelings you can never return all every thing is more supportable than to talk of our separation
Trust in my honour Shew me but the confidence which I will venture to say I deserve and then will that union no longer be impeded which in future I am certain will never be repented
You doubt then my integrity You suspect  
You give me then up
Not follow you And who has power to prevent me
O tyranny what submission is it you exact May I not even enquire into the dreadful mystery of this morning
And may I not acquaint you with it should it be discovered
If you do not hate and detest me if I am not loathsome and abhorrent to you O quit me not thus insensibly Cecilia my beloved Cecilia speak to me at least one word of less severity Look at me once more and tell me we part not for-ever
Have thought Oh Cecilia is it then all over
Good heavens whence this reproach Did you not permit me to wait upon you with the result of my enquiries Had I not your consent but why do you look thus disturbed Your eyes are red you have been weeping Oh my Cecilia have I any share in your sorrow Those tears which never flow weakly tell me have they  has one of them been shed upon my account
How strange is this language how strange are these looks What new has come to pass Has any fresh calamity happened Is there yet some evil which I do not expect
You terrify you shock you amaze me What dreadful blow awaits me For what horror are you preparing me That which I have just experienced and which tore you from me even at the foot of the altar still remains inexplicable still continues to be involved in darkness and mystery for the wretch who separated us I have never been able to discover
No none though since we parted I have never rested a moment
Oh what
what does this mean loveliest dearest Cecilia my betrothed my affianced wife why flow those tears which agony only can wring from you Why refuse me that hand which so lately was the pledge of your faith Am I not the same Delvile to whom so few days since you gave it Why will you not open to him your heart Why thus distrust his honour and repulse his tenderness Oh why giving him such exquisite misery refuse him the smallest consolation
In this presence at least I hope I may be heard though my letters have been unanswered my visits refused though inexorably you have flown me 
Pardon me madam this is a condition to which I have never assented I come not to release but to claim her I am hers and hers wholly I protest it in the face of the world The time therefore is now past for the sacrifice which you demand since scarce are you more my mother than I consider her as my wife
That you wholly give me up is that what you would say Oh how have I offended you how have I merited a displeasure that can draw upon me such a sentence Answer speak to me Cecilia what is it I have done
Yet what have you conceived to me an aversion has any dreadful and horrible antipathy succeeded to your esteem tell tell me without disguise do you hate do you abhor me
No madam she must not go on if she does not utterly abhor me I will not suffer her to go on Pardon pardon me Cecilia but your too exquisite delicacy is betraying not only my happiness but your own Once more therefore I conjure you to hear me and then if deliberately and unbiassed you renounce me I will never more distress you by resisting your decree
All that has past between us the vows I have offered you of faith constancy and affection the consent I obtained from you to be legally mine the bond of settlement I have had drawn up and the high honour you conferred upon me in suffering me to lead you to the altar all these particulars are already known to so many that the least reflection must convince you they will soon be concealed from none tell me then if your own fame pleads not for me and if the scruples which lead you to refuse by taking another direction will not with much more propriety urge nay enjoin you to accept me You hesitate at least O Miss Beverley I see in that hesitation  
First let her speak first let her answer what she has already deigned to listen to
Heavens madam what a speech
At length then madam are you satisfied is your purpose now answered and is the dagger you have transfixed in my heart sunk deep enough to appease you
No we will not part if you force me madam from her you will drive me to distraction What is there in this world that can offer me a recompense And what can pride even to the proudest afford as an equivalent Her perfections you acknowledge her greatness of mind is like your own she has generously given me her heart Oh sacred and fascinating charge Shall I after such a deposite consent to an eternal separation Repeal repeal your sentence my Cecilia let us live to ourselves and our consciences and leave the vain prejudices of the world to those who can be paid by them for the loss of all besides
Oh madam for mercy for humanity forbear this cruel supplication
And can I only deserve them by a compliance to which not merely my happiness but my reason must be sacrificed What honour do I injure that is not factitious What evil threatens our union that is not imaginary In the general commerce of the world it may be right to yield to its prejudices but in matters of serious importance it is weakness to be shackled by scruples so frivolous and it is cowardly to be governed by the customs we condemn Religion and the laws of our country should then alone be consulted and where those are neither opposed nor infringed we should hold ourselves superior to all other considerations
The curses of my father O no he could never be so barbarous
O speak not such words to disgrace her  to be banished by you  present not I conjure you such scenes to my imagination
Hold hold madam this is more than I can bear
It shall not be cease cease to distract me be content madam  you have conquered
Oh Miss Beverley if you are not happy  
That voice those looks  they speak not serenity Oh if I have injured your peace if that heart which pure as angels deserves to be as sacred from sorrow through my means or for my sake suffers any diminution of tranquility 
I know well your greatness of soul and if this dreadful sacrifice gives lasting torture only to myself if of your returning happiness I could be assured I would struggle to bear it
Heaven then bless and hovering angels watch you
Is it possible To me were you coming
Oh what a voice is that it pierces my very soul
O suffer me to support you you are not able to stand whither is it you would go
Can I bear this no it shakes all my resolution  loveliest and most beloved Cecilia forgive my rash declaration which I here retract and forswear and which no false pride no worthless vanity shall again surprise from me  raise then your eyes 
Stay madam stay I cannot let you go I see your intention I see your dreadful purpose you will work upon the feelings of Miss Beverley you will extort from her a promise to see me no more
I cannot I will not give her up nor now madam nor ever I protest it most solemnly I affirm it by my best hopes I swear it by all that I hold sacred
Great Heaven what is it you have done where are you wounded what direful curse have you denounced against your son
Heaven be praised my mother has not voluntarily cursed me
Alas I have been preparing myself for that purpose and waited but your commands to finally determine me
Look at me with less abhorrence for I come but to resign myself to your will
Revive then my mother rely upon our plighted honours and think only of your health for your son will never more offend you
How indulgent you are I am now going post to Dr Lyster whom I shall entreat to come hither instantly but I am fearful of again disturbing my mother and must therefore rely upon you to acquaint her what is become of me
You are all goodness and how I shall support but I mean not to return hither at least not to this house unless indeed Dr Lyster’s account should be alarming I leave my mother therefore to your kindness and only hope only entreat that your own health your own peace of mind neither by attendance upon her by anxiety by pity for her son 
The promise you have made in both our names to my mother I shall hold myself bound to observe I see indeed that her reason or her life would fall the sacrifice of further opposition of myself therefore it is no longer time to think I take of you no leave I cannot yet I would fain tell you the high reverence but it is better to say nothing 
I will one thing I should yet wish to say I have been impetuous violent unreasonable with shame and with regret I recollect how impetuous and how unreasonable I have persecuted where I ought in silence to have submitted I have reproached where I ought in candour to have approved and in the vehemence with which I have pursued you I have censured that very dignity of conduct which has been the basis of my admiration my esteem my devotion but never can I forget and never without fresh wonder remember the sweetness with which you have borne with me even when most I offended you For this impatience this violence this inconsistency I now most sincerely beg your pardon and if before I go you could so far condescend as to pronounce my forgiveness with a lighter heart I think I should quit you
I understand the generous indulgence you have shewn me an indulgence I shall ever revere and ever grieve to have abused I ask you not to remember me far far happier do I wish you than such a remembrance could make you but I will pain the humanity of your disposition no longer You will tell my mother but no matter Heaven preserve you my angelic Cecilia Miss Beverley I mean Heaven guide protect and bless you And should I see you no more should this be the last sad moment  
May I hear at least of your tranquillity for that alone can have any chance to quiet or repress the anguish I feel here
May I wait upon you for one instant before or after you dine
You will not I hope refuse to hear me I cannot write what I have to say 
I presumed madam to wait upon you from the permission of my mother but I believe I have obtained it so late that the influence I hoped from it is past
I would thank you for the honour you do her were it less pointedly exclusive I have however no right of reproach yet suffer me to ask could you madam after such a parting after a renunciation so absolute of all future claim upon you which though extorted from me by duty I was bound having promised to fulfil by principle  could you imagine me so unsteady so dishonourable as to obtrude myself into your presence while that promise was still in force
There spoke Miss Beverley the same the unaltered Miss Beverley I hoped to find yet is she unaltered am I not too precipitate and is the tale I have heard about Belfield a dream an error a falsehood
Had I indeed thought it a question I would not have asked it but never for a moment did I credit it till the rigour of your repulse alarmed me You have condescended now to account for that and I am therefore encouraged to make known to you the purpose of my venturing this visit Yet not with confidence shall I speak if scarce even with hope it is a purpose that is the offspring of despair 
I would mention nothing without her concurrence she has given it me and my father himself has permitted my present application
 Is it possible  ah Miss Beverley  once my own Cecilia do you can you wish it possible
What hope would this sweetness give me were my scheme almost any other than it is but you cannot no it would be unreasonable it would be madness to expect your compliance it is next to madness even in me to wish it but how shall a man who is desperate be prudent and circumspect
You know not what you say all noble as you are the sacrifice I have to propose 
For my life would I not resign it but oh how soon will you withdraw it when the only terms upon which I can hold it are those of making it sign from itself its natural right and inheritance
Can you for my sake make such a sacrifice as this can you for a man who for yours is not permitted to give up his name give up yourself the fortune of your late uncle consent to such settlements as I can make upon you from my own part with so splendid an income wholly and for-ever  and with only your paternal 10000 l condescend to become mine as if your uncle had never existed and you had been Heiress to no other wealth
Pardon madam a trial such as no man can be vindicated in making I have indulged a romantic whim which your better judgment disapproves and I receive but the mortification my presumption deserved
Your ability or inability I presume are elective
Impossible utterly impossible
My father
Oh distraction what horrible confirmation is coming
you  only could have made this credible
Oh I had heard it as the most infamous of falshoods my heart swelled with indignation at so villainous a calumny and had it not come from my father my resentment at it had been inveterate
Exaggerated indeed I was told you had been surprised concealed with Belfield in a back room I was told that your parental fortune was totally exhausted and that during your minority you had been a dealer with Jews I was told all this by my father you may believe I had else not easily been made hear it
True Oh never then was truth so scandalously wronged I denied the whole charge I disbelieved every syllable  I pledged my own honour to prove every assertion false
Why does Miss Beverley weep and why has she given me this alarm these things must at least have been misrepresented deign then to clear up a mystery in which suspense is torture
Oh little did I credit that he knew indeed so well this last condition was impracticable his assertions were without proof I thought them prejudiced surmises and I came in the full hope I should convict him of his error My mother too who warmly and even angrily defended you was as firmly satisfied as myself that the whole was a mistake and that enquiry would prove your fortune as undiminished as your purity How will she be shocked at the tale I have no to unfold how irritated at your injuries from Harrel how grieved that your own too great benevolence should be productive of such black aspersions upon your character
Would you then have listened to my romantic proposal
Oh yet then most generous of human beings yet then be mine By our own oeconomy we will pay off our mortgages by living a while abroad we will clear all our estates I will still keep the name to which my family is bigotted and my gratitude for your compliance shall make you forget what you lose by it
My friends are henceforth out of the question my father's concurrence with a proposal he knew you had not power to grant was in fact a mere permission to insult you for if instead of dark charges he had given any authority for your losses I had myself spared you the shock you have so undeservedly received from hearing it But to consent to a plan which could not be accepted  to make mea tool to offer indignity to Miss Beverley He has released me from his power by so erroneous an exertion of it and my own honour has a claim to which his commands must give place That honour binds me to Miss Beverley as forcibly as my admiration and no voice but her own shall determine my future destiny
But will her sanction be sufficient and may I hope in obtaining it the security of yours
Will you not then from time to time suffer me to consult with you
Can you forgive the dismal and unsatisfactory letter I wrote you I would not disobey you twice in the same manner and I could not till now have written in any other
Alas yes and the result is most alarming they all agree my mother is in a dangerous way and they rather forbear to oppose than advise her going abroad but upon that she is earnestly bent and intends to set out without delay I shall return to her therefore with all speed and mean not to take any rest till have seen her
I must hasten to the credentials by which I am authorised for coming and I must hasten to prove if Miss Beverley has not flattered my mother in her appeal
I cannot in decency speak my opinion of it read it yourself  and let me hear yours
O no rather let us now spurn it for ever those conflicts must indeed be ended but not by a separation still more bitter than all of them
She has always maintained an independent mind always judged for herself and refused all other arbitration when so impetuously she parted us my father's will happened to be her's and thence their concurrence my father of a temper immoveable and stern retains stubbornly the prejudices which once have taken possession of him my mother generous as fiery and noble as proud is open to conviction and no sooner convinced than ingenuous in acknowledging it and thence their dissention From my father I may hope forgiveness but must never expect concession from my mother I may hope all she ought to grant for pardon but her vehemence and she has every great quality that can dignify human nature
Now then now is the time when your generous admiration of her is put to the test see what she writes to you she has left to me all explanation but I insisted upon some credential lest you should believe I only owed her concurrence to a happy dream
O now then let our long suspenses end hear me with the candour my mother has already listened to me  be mine my Cecilia at once and force me not by eternal scruples to risk another separation
No not a moment I would but ensure you mine and go with her all over the world
It is on his account wholly I am thus earnestly precipitate If I do not by an immediate marriage prevent his further interference all I have already suffered may again be repeated and some fresh contest with my mother may occasion another relapse
Say it not I conjure you we shall yet live I hope to prove the contrary
I grieve indeed that your goodness should so severely be tried yet did you not condescend to commit the arbitration to my mother
She has merely accorded it from a certainty there is no other resource Believe me therefore my whole hope rests upon your present compliance My father I am certain by his letter will now hear neither petition nor defence on the contrary he will only enrage at the temerity of offering to confute him But when he knows you are his daughter his honour will then be concerned in yours and it will be as much his desire to have it cleared as it is now to have it censured
Oh why must I linger out month after month in this wretched uncertainty If I wait I am undone my father by the orders I must unavoidably leave will discover the preparations making without his consent and he will work upon you in my absence and compel you to give me up
I am but too sure that the least intimation in his present irritable state of mind reaching him of my intentions would make him not scruple in his fury pronouncing some malediction upon my disobedience that neither of us I must own could tranquilly disregard
And as instead of keeping up three houses in the manner my father does at present I mean to put my whole estate out to nurse while we reside for a while abroad or in the country I doubt not but in a very few years we shall be as rich and as easy as we shall desire
Still therefore as a single man I mean to make the journey and I shall take care by the time I return to have all things in readiness for claiming my sweet Bride Tell me then now if you can reasonably oppose this plan
Do you not try me too much to talk now of precipitancy after such painful waiting such wearisome expectation I ask you not to involve your own affairs in confusion by accompanying me abroad sweet to me as would be such an indulgence I would not make a run-away of you in the opinion of the world All I wish is the secret certainty I cannot be robbed of you that no cruel machinations may again work our separation that you are mine unalterably mine beyond the power of caprice or ill fortune
We might then according to the favour or displeasure of my father settle wholly abroad for the present or occasionally visit him in England my mother would be always and openly our friend Oh be firm then I conjure you to the promise you have given her and deign to be mine on the conditions she prescribes She will be bound to you for ever by so generous a concession and even her health may be restored by the cessation of her anxieties What such a wife such a mother what will be wanting for me Could I lament not being richer I must be rapacious indeed Speak then my Cecilia relieve me from the agony of this eternal uncertainty and tell me your word is invariable as your honour and tell me my mother gives not her sanction in vain
Here madam comes one whose sight will bring peace and pleasure to you
This this is the sight my heart has thus long desired the wife of my choice taken to the bosom of the parent I revere be yet but well my beloved mother and I will be thankful for every calamity that has led to so sweet a conclusion
I will not be rallied from my purpose if I cannot entertain it will be something to weary you for that may incline you to take rest which will be answering a better purpose
Perhaps a little of both 
Why it is but common prudence to feel our way a little before we mention what we most wish and so cast the hazard of the refusal upon something rather less important
Why this silence my Cecilia
Write still then but direct to Ostend I shall be quicker than the post and I would not lose a letter a line a word from you for all the world can offer me
She is now on the road to Margate I hope to be there to receive her I mean but to bid you adieu and be gone
You are thoughtful are you unhappy sweetest Cecilia most excellent of human creatures if I have made you unhappy and I must  it is inevitable 
You are too good to deserve you is not possible but to afflict you is inhuman
There is not indeed much danger Have you pen and ink here
You have been writing to me you say I will begin a letter myself
Fool I could have done this without coming
Since you allow me so sweet a claim a claim to which all others yield and which if you repent not giving me will make all others nearly immaterial to me I will own to you that all indeed is not well I have been hasty  you will blame me I deserve indeed to be blamed entrusted with your peace and happiness to suffer rage resentment violence to make me forego what I owed to such a deposite If your blame however stops short of repentance but it cannot
Generous condescending Cecilia Words such as these hung there not upon me an evil the most depressing would be almost more than I could bear would make me too blest for morality
Shew but as much firmness as you have shewn sweetness and I will fear to tell you nothing
Immediately from your lodgings I went where I had ordered a chaise and stopt only to change horses till I reached Delvile Castle My father saw me with surprise and received me with coldness I was compelled by my situation to be abrupt and told him I came before I accompanied my mother abroad to make him acquainted with an affair which I thought myself bound in duty and respect to suffer no one to communicate to him but myself He then sternly interrupted me and declared in high terms that if this affair concerned you  he would not listen to it I attempted to remonstrate upon this injustice when he passionately broke forth into new and horrible charges against you affirming that he had them from authority as indisputable as ocular demonstration I was then certain of some foul play 
I told him some gross imposition had been practiced upon him and earnestly conjured him no longer to conceal from me by whom This unfortunately encreased his rage imposition he said was not so easily played upon him he left that for me who so readily was duped while for himself he had only given credit to a man of much consideration in Suffolk who had known you from a child who had solemnly assured him he had repeatedly endeavoured to reclaim you who had rescued you from the hands of Jews at his own hazard and loss and who actually shewed him bonds acknowledging immense debts which were signed with your own hand
I was scarce myself while I heard him I demanded even with fierceness his author whom I scrupled not to execrate as he deserved he coldly answered he was bound by an oath never to reveal him nor should he repay his honourable attention to his family by a breach of his own word were it even less formally engaged I then lost all patience to mention honour I cried was a farce where such infamous calumnies were listened to  but let me not shock you unnecessarily you may readily conjecture what passed
I have nor does he yet know I am married in so much wrath there was no room for narration I only pledged myself by all I held sacred never to rest till I had cleared your fame by the detection of this villainy and then left him without further explanation
Believe me I am ill at ease under it if you wish it when you have heard me I will go to him immediately if not I will write and you shall yourself dictate what
My first step when I left the Castle was to send a letter to my mother in which I entreated her to set our as soon as possible for Margate as I was detained from her unavoidably and was unwilling my delay should either retard our journey or oblige her to travel faster At Margate I hoped to be as soon as herself if not before he
I had business another way I came hither
No but soon
My Cecilia it is now you must summon your fortitude I left my father without an explanation on my part but not till in his rage of asserting his authority he had unwarily named his informant
That informant the most deceitful of men was your long pretended friend Mr Monckton
I rode to the Grove on hack-horses and on a full gallop the whole way I got to him early in the evening I was shewn into his library I told him my errand  You look pale my love You are not well 
Not dead dangerously indeed wounded but thank heaven not actually dead
He may I hope he will
I meant not to have gone such lengths far from it I hold duels in abhorrence as unjustifiable acts of violence and savage devices of revenge I have offended against my own conviction but transported with passion at his infamous charges I was not master of my reason I accused him of his perfidy he denied it I told him I had it from my father he changed the subject to pour abuse upon him I insisted on a recantation to clear you he asked by what right I fiercely answered by a husband's His countenance then explained at least the motives of his treachery he loves you himself he had probably schemed to keep you free till his wife died and then concluded his machinations would secure you his own For this purpose finding he was in danger of losing you he was content even to blast your character rather than suffer you to escape him But the moment I acknowledged my marriage he grew more furious than myself and in short for why relate the frenzies of rage we walked out together my travelling pistols were already charged I gave him his choice of them and the challenge being mine for insolence joined with guilt had robbed me of all forbearance he fired first but missed me I then demanded whether he would clear your fame he called out Fire I will make no terms I did fire and unfortunately aimed better We had neither of us any second all was the result of immediate passion but I soon got people to him and assisted in conveying him home He was at first believed to be dead and I was seized by his servants but he afterwards shewed signs of life and by sending for my friend Biddulph I was released Such is the melancholy transaction I came to relate to you flattering myself it would something less shock you from me than from another yet my own real concern for the affair the repentance with which from the moment the wretch fell I was struck in being his destroyer and the sorrow the remorse rather which I felt in coming to wound you with such black such fearful intelligence  you to whom all I owe is peace and comfort these thoughts gave me to much disturbance that in face I knew less than any other how to prepare you for such a tale
If it is yet possible you can be sufficiently interested in my fate to care what becomes of me aid me now with your counsel or rather with your instructions I am scarce able to think for myself and to be thought for by you would yet be a consolation that would give me spirit for any thing
Forgive me I meant not a reproach I meant but to state my own consciousness how little I deserve from you You talked to me of going to my father do you still wish it
I will go then without doubt too happy to be guided by you which-ever way I steer I have now indeed much to tell him but whatever may be his wrath there is little fear at this time that my own temper cannot bear it what next shall I do
Shall I go immediately to Margate or shall I first ride hither
I please nothing but by your direction to follow that is my only chance of pleasure Which then shall I do you will not now refuse to direct me
Speak to me then my love and tell me why are you thus silent is it painful to you to counsel me
Oh my Cecilia call back your recollection You know not what you say you take no interest in what you answer
Sigh not so bitterly if you have any compassion sigh not so bitterly  I cannot bear to hear you
Good Heaven distract me not with this horror speak not to me in such broken sentences Do you here me Cecilia why will you not answer me
Oh beloved of my heart kill me not with this terror call back your faculties  awake from this dreadful insensibility tell me at least you know me tell me I have not tortured you quite to madness  sole darling of my affections my own my wedded Cecilia rescue me from this agony it is more than I can support 
Hurry not your tender spirits I beseech you we have time enough we will talk about business by and by
Good Heaven already past ten you must turn me out my Cecilia or calumny will still be busy even though poor Monckton is quiet
That you shall decide for me yourself whether to Delvile Castle to finish one tale and wholly communicate another or to Margate to hasten my mother abroad before the news of this calamity reaches her
A trial must follow and it will go I fear but hardly with me the challenge was mine his servants can all witness I went to him not he to me Oh my Cecilia the rashness of which I have been guilty is so opposite to my principles and all generous as is your silence I know it so opposite to yours that never should his blood be on my hands wretch as he was never will my heart be quiet more
I will go stay do which and whatever you bid me but should what I fear come to pass should my mother continue ill my father inflexible should this wretched man die and should England no longer be a country I shall love to dwell in  could you then bear to own would you then content to follow me 
No my Cecilia I am not so selfish If we have not happier days we will at least wait for more desperate necessity With the uncertainty if I have not this man's life to answer for at the hazard of my own to take my wife my bride from the kingdom I must fly  to make her a fugitive and an exile in the first publishing that she is mine No if I am not a destined alien for life I can never permit it Nothing less believe me shall ever urge my consent to wound the chaste propriety of your character by making you an eloper with a duelist
Happiness is much in arrears with us and though my violence may have frightened it away your sweetness and gentleness will yet attract it back all that for me is in store must be received at your hands what is offered in any other way I shall only mistake for evil droop not therefore my generous Cecilia but in yourself preserve me
Peace then be with you my love  my comforting my soul-reviving Cecilia Peace such as angels give and such as may drive from your mind the remembrance of this bitter hour
I thank you Sir
I seem to have made a general confusion here pray I beg 
I fear I hurry you madam you are upon business I ought to beg your pardon  my entrance I believe was unseasonable 
I should have been rather surprised to have met you here so late  so unexpectedly so deeply engaged had I not happened to see your servant in the street who told me the honour I should be likely to have by coming
Give me leave madam to see you to your carriage
Rather for me is that question for mine I believe is the greater surprise
By and bye I will go on postilion
What Sir back to Rumford
Rumford you came then from Suffolk hither from Suffolk to this very house
Who is that now in it
Your maid and she waits for you thus at the door 
Tell the man madam whither to go
 I order him you came not hither to receive orders from me  where was it you had purposed to rest
No place taken you purposed then to stay here I have perhaps driven you away
Nothing I never have had I never will have a doubt I will know  I will have conviction for every thing Postilion drive to St James's-square to Mr Delvile's I here madam I will wait upon you
It cannot be I will follow you in a few minutes drive on postilion
Cecilia I have ever believed you spotless as an angel and by heaven I believe you so still in spite of appearances  in defiance of every thing Now then be satisfied I will be with you very soon Mean while take this letter I was just going to send to you Postilion drive on or be at your peril
Hold stop what is it you are doing Monsters of savage barbarity are you murdering my wife
Inhuman wretches unfeeling execrable wretches what is it you have done to her how came she hither who brought her who dragged her by what infamous usage has she been sunk into this state
Peace I will not hear your falshoods peace and begone 
Oh my Cecilia where hast thou been thus long how have I lost thee what dreadful calamity has befallen thee answer me my love raise your sweet head and answer me  oh speak say to me any thing the bitterest words will be mercy to this silence 
Who am I
Well indeed may you disclaim me refuse all forgiveness load me with hatred and reproach and consign me to eternal anguish I have merited severer punishment still I have behaved like a monster and I am abhorrent to myself
To mangle you how horrible but I deserve it look not however so terrified and I will tear myself away from you Suffer me but to assist in removing you from this place and I will only watch you at a distance and never see you more till you permit me to approach you
Do you not know me or do you only mean to kill me by the question
From Mr Monckton no but he lives and will recover
Too cruel yet justly cruel Cecilia  is then Delvile utterly renounced the guilty the unhappy Delvile is he cast off for ever have you driven him wholly from your heart do you deny him even a place in your remembrance
O what is it you mean is it me or my name you thus disown
All-gracious powers her reason is utterly gone
what is death to this blow Cecilia I am content to part with thee
Art thou gone so soon my wife my Cecilia have I lost thee already
Dreadful dreadful what a sight is this 
why is she here upon the floor could you not even allow her a bed Who attends her Who waits upon her Why has nobody sent for help Don't answer me I will not hear you fly this moment for a physician bring two bring three bring all you can find
Well sir is it not all over is it not impossible she can live
 Perhaps do not stab me with such a word
I have more reliance upon you than upon the whole faculty come therefore and prescribe for her  take some new course 
Never mention her to me I cannot bear it Go up to her dear Doctor and if you want a consultation send if you please for every physician in town
Well my dear Doctor Lyster you  still I hope 
Don't go on Sir I will not have her days limited I sent not for you to give me such an account
Ah Sir think not of me now you must shew me no kindness I am not in a state to bear it
And he has not disturbed her
I think then I will yet see her once more
The shock is over  tell me however is there any chance I may hurt her 
Well then I may grieve perhaps hereafter that once more that one glance
Oh merciful powers Take or destroy her let her not linger thus rather let me lose her for ever Oh far rather would I see her dead than in this dreadful condition
I pray not now for thy life inhumanly as I have treated thee I am not yet so hardened as to wish thy misery lengthened no quick be thy restoration or short as pure thy passage to eternity Oh my Cecilia lovely however altered sweet even in the arms of death and insanity and dearer to my tortured heart in this calamitous state than in all thy pride of health and beauty 
Is all over no ray of reason left no knowledge of thy wretched Delvile  no none the hand of death is on her and she is utterly gone sweet suffering excellence loved lost expiring Cecilia but I will not repine peace and kindred angels are watching to receive thee and if thou art parted from thyself it were impious to lament thou shouldst be parted from me Yet in thy tomb will be deposited all that to me could render existence supportable every frail chance of happiness every sustaining hope and all alleviation of sorrow
With your lady is your lady then in town
At Mrs Belfield's is her daughter returned home
O Dr Lyster ask of the sweet creature if these circumstances offer any extenuation for the fatal jealousy which seized me never by myself while I live will it be forgiven but she perhaps who is all softness all compassion and all peace may some time hence think my sufferings almost equal to my offence
Belfield to obviate any imputation of impertinence in my enquiries I deny not what I presume you have been told by herself that I have the nearest interest in whatever concerns the lady from whom we are just now parted I must beg therefore an explicit account of the purpose of your private conversation with her
What you assert upon your honour requires no other testimony Your gallantry and your probity are equally well known to me with either therefore I am content and by no means require the intervention of both
Oh let me not even to myself let me not trace the agony of that moment where to seek her I knew not why she was in London I could not divine for what purpose she had given the postilion a new direction I could form no idea Yet it appeared that she wished to avoid me and once more in the frenzy of my disappointment I supposed Belfield a party in her concealment Again therefore I sought him  at his own house at the coffee-house where I had left him in vain wherever I came I just missed him for hearing of my search he went with equal restlessness from place to place to meet me I rejoice we both failed a repetition of my enquiries in my then irritable state must inevitably have provoked the most fatal resentment
I will not dwell upon the scenes that followed my laborious search my fruitless wanderings the distraction of my suspense the excess of my despair even Belfield the fiery Belfield when I met with him the next day was so much touched by my wretchedness that he bore with all my injustice feeling noble young man never will I lose the remembrance of his high-souled patience
And now Dr Lyster go to my Cecilia tell her this tale and try for you have skill sufficient to soften yet not wound her with my sufferings If then she can bear to see me to bless me with the sound of her sweet voice no longer at war with her intellects to hold out to me her loved hand in token of peace and forgiveness  Oh Dr Lyster preserver of my life in hers give to me but that exquisite moment and every past evil will be for ever obliterated
Sweet injured excellence wife of my heart sole object of my chosen affection dost thou yet live do I hear thy loved voice do I see thee again art thou my Cecilia and have I indeed not lost thee 
Alas art thou indeed my Cecilia so pale so emaciated Oh suffering angel and couldst thou then call upon Delvile the guilty but heart-broken Delvile thy destroyer thy murderer and yet not call to execrate him
Angelic creature can you give to me again a hand so ill deserved can you look with such compassion on the author of your woes on the wretch who for an instant could doubt the purity of a mind so seraphic
I am not worthy this joy I know not how to sustain it a forgiveness such as this when I believed you must hate me for ever when repulse and aversion were all I dared expect when my own inhumanity had bereft thee of thy reason  when the grave the pitiless grave was already open to receive thee 
Oh words of transport and extacy oh partner of my life friend solace darling of my bosom that so lately I thought expiring that I folded to my bleeding heart in the agony of eternal separation 
Is this all the grace accorded me
True my Cecilia and generous and condescending as true and if you can thus sweetly comply I will gratefully forbear making any opposition Too much already have you suffered from the impetuosity of my temper but I will try to curb it in future by the remembrance of your injuries
When Lady Honoria whispers I always suspect some mischief
This lady will at least by condescending to become one of it secure us from any danger that such contempt may spread further
Ah how much higher must we all rise or how much lower must you fall ere any levelling principle will approximate us with YOU
